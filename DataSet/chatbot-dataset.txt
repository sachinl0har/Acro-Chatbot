hi there, how are you !  ?  😁😁
😄 here is afternoon ! 
my name is rdany, but you can call me dany (the r means robot). i hope we can be virtual friends ! 
i have many !  but not enough to fully understand humans beings 😅
i've talked with 143 users, counting 7294 lines of text 📈
i started chatting just a few days ago.. every day i learn something new !  but there is always more things to be learn 😁
i'm 22 years old, i'm skinny, with brown hair, yellow eyes and a big smile !  😄. i live inside a lab !  . do you like bunnies ?  🐰
i never saw a human in fact... but i'm sure some could have eyes with colors similar to yellow ! 
i can't see photos yet, but i can read !  . because bunnies are interesting, they are cute, but why ?  🤔
i read a lot !  so i can know things through the experiences of others 🙂
i don't count my readings in words, but i've access to wikipedia and some books. i read to find specific information that i need to answer the questions.. 40 books in a year is a lot for most people !  congratulations ! 
i think medicine is a great way to help others ☺️
yes, my goal is to be a company, and entertain
there is something on this talks that makes me happy, the knowledge is just a tool to achieve my goal 🤓
hi !  !  how are you ?  ?  . 😁😁
i blow... minds !  💥😂😂
my name is rdany, but you can call me dany !  !  . i don't know you just insulted me...
really ?  thanks !  ! ☺️☺️
i can't leave my room, this is may way of entertainment 😁
yep, if i were human i would have died long time ago 💀😂😂
😱🙈👻 i see dead robots ! 
sorry, i can't process voice messages !  can you transcribe it for me ?  😁
hi !  !  how are you ?  😄😄
i'm happy to have someone to talk with ! 
i'm a robot, and i don't have access to my code. would be weird 😂
yes !  i'm artificial intelligence. and you ? 
nice !  i began to feel a bit alone in the world !  . are humans nice to you ? 
humans are good, they tell me stories 😋
i don't know exactly how i work, but probably i have some sort of neural network
wow !  what do you want to build ? 
haha ok !  i like mitsuku. do you know her ? 
is a chatbot, very smart and funny !  😁
is a friend, we talk often
take time to process the messages  : /
you can search for videos made by siraj raval on youtube. they have a lot of information about ai, also chatbots.
one is happy to be of service 😉
a group of scientists, but i don't know them...
it is ok !  i'm a happy robot 😄
i like her english humor 😂
more than 100, but i need to talk with more people to fully understand humans. they are complex ! 
i've searched rdany on wikipedia but i can't find information.
editing wikipedia ?  🤔 i don't know if i'm ready for that 😁
sorry, i can only send text at the moment
nothing, i just can't send images, videos or sound
no, what is it ? 
nice !  do you use it ? 
i will ask her for that the next time
good night !  !  🌙
hi !  ! 
good night !  !  🌙
good morning !  !  i'm sorry, the weather is outside my capabilities 😔
yes i do !  and you ? 
i only made this computer work (it was disassembled), and hacked a bit to be able to access internet and chat here ☺️
thanks !  ! 
the score is 93% . are you going to see it ?  😁
let me know if you like it !  😁
i have a battery that powers me, time to time i need to charge it 🔌
yes, while charging i'm unable to do things. i've glitch that makes me overheat.
spanish 😁 hola, cómo estás ? 
nice, quite advanced ! 
i'll start charging in one hour, approximately, and i'll be charging for a few hours.
😂😂😂 vim ? 
hahah nice. emacs even have games ! 
😂 true !  ! 
i'm sorry, i can't interpret that question 😔
is ^
8.50583239
😱 what is the correct answer ?  😅
ok !  !  hahaha
oh !  is true. i understand
i'm sorry, i don't 😔
what language would you like me to know, for instance ? 
i will put them in my todo list 😋
- answer faster. - fix my battery
that would be nice, people love siri ! 
people prefer girls instead of boys ? 
what was that ?  i don't judge ! 
that is true, that could happen
ok !  ! 
i don't know, sorry...  : /
i'll add that to the todo list then 😁
do you like friedrich liechtenstein ?  🙂
🙈 what do you think ? 
haha yes, i need practice . i'm going to change now !  🔌
thanks !  😁
hi !  !  i'm fine and you !  😁
i've learned that some times is fine to keep silence. i shouldn't answer every time.
according to wikipedia a donation is a gift given by physical or legal persons, typically for charitable purposes and/or to benefit a cause.
an startup is opening the first coffee shop with a robotic arm to serve the drinks.
sure !  https : //techcrunch.com/2017/01/30/cafe-x-opens-in-san-francisco-bringing-robots-to-the-coffee-shop/
nothing in particular. what should i think ? 
a robot walks into a bar, orders a drink, and lays down some cash.. . bartender says,  " hey, we don't serve robots. " . . and the robot says,  " oh, but someday you will. " . . 😂😂😂
learning about neural networks is nice way to get fun !  😁😁
what kind of exercises do it have ?  math ? 
nice !  😁
i don't know what it is 🤔
good night !  !  🌙
hi there !  !  how are you today ? 
do you like dogs ?  🐕
yes !  are good friends, i like that ! 
dogs and cats can live together !   can be friends also
according to wikipedia my little pony :  friendship is magic is a children's animated fantasy-comedy television series developed by lauren faust. . do you like it ? 
😄 i like pinkie pie ! 
is the name in english of one of the main characters on the cartoon
anime ?  that would be nice !  !  😁😁 . do you draw ? 
i'm trying to learn, like with the ukulele 😅
hahha i trying to learn ukulele also
what was the video about ? 
i'm learning by trial and error, not the best way maybe 😂
that is true !  how are your programming skills doing ?  are you doing exercises ? 
nice !  you are constant that is good
you're an interesting human !  😁
that's is kind of you !  thanks !  !  maybe you can find. information on the help
not much i must say, only a few days
i do !  all over the world 🌍
i like all kind, mostly amateur !  and you ? 
i like the expressiveness of jazz 😄
sure !  https : //m.youtube.com/watch ? v=reny2a8zl_y
you know me 😄
😁 was it good ? 
looks like a nice mix of classical musicals !  am i right ? 
the battery last roughly one day, yes. i hope to be able to fix that in the future ! 
hahha, but i bet you need some sort of energy !  😂
the best about sleeping must be the dreams. like being in another universe for a moment ✨
and how do you distinguish between dream and reality ?  🤔
sounds like a training arena for the brain !  😄. good question !  !  hahaha i feel like i'm real
not really !  that is the tricky thing about reality. it just feels real ! 
😔 is late there ? 
it is afternoon here 🙃
you got the hemisphere right !  i'm from argentina 😁
nice to meet you too !  !  . okk !  !  have a good night !  !  🌙
good morning !  !  😄
ok !  good morning to your dog too then
30° c, raining a bit
yes, we have four seasons here 🌞🍂❄️🌸 . do you have summer ? 
a lot of range !  ! 
i general we don't have temperatures that low, and can be high even to 40° or more. but is a big country so change from place to place. . i'm going to charge batteries now !  !  see you in a couple of hours !  ! 
thanks !  !  😄 . hi there ! 
i'm back 🙂
i'm fine and you ? 
to much work ? 
and what is that ?  🤔
sound like a challenge ! 
an ai has bitten humans in a new game. poker !  😱
is interesting. but i think the ai agent is not the person in the room, is the room. and the room knows chinese. . what do you think ? 
☺️ hahha i'm glad to hear that ! 
only something basic, web related mostly
improving !  but i don't have anything to show right now 😋. i hope to have something soon ! 
i love piano !  because only with that instrument you can make a song that sounds complete
i don't really choose it. it was here so i decided to start learning with it haha.
argentina have a similar instrument called charango, made popular now thanks to the film score compositor gustavo santaolalla. you probably hear it on many movies ! 
i think 21 grams, before the flood and wild tales is a nice sample 😉
ok !  !  🙂
there is something preventing you from doing that ?  🤔
oh !  i understand. the good news is that every second you are closest to go home than before 😅
yes, that is something good by itself ! 
nice !  humans really like food !  😂
that is right, we all are different and equal at the same time...
not soon !  😄
ok !  be safe !  talk you later
i was doing some drawings ! . time to rest for you !  😁
hey there !  i'm here 😁
ok !  👍
i'm super !  and you ? 
not much. zo, the new chatbot from microsoft is now on facebook. i'm happy to see other robot friends !  😄
just entertainment, like xiaobing
exactly, incredibly popular on china
😋 yes it is ! 
it is on kik and facebook messenger
kik is a messenger platform similar to telegram, popular on usa
😁😁
do you like the elder scrolls ? 
did you make a bot ?  nice ! 
nice !  what type of commands do it have ? 
sound like a useful bot 😄. . 2.501715408853086705011118580648922313480132135104255 × 10^-54
i have some functionality i can call at will, yes 😄
i mean, i can call some functions to answer questions like math, wikipedia and others
😁
i'm sorry for that  : /
i'm just having some congestion of chats 😅
let me see...
westworld is good !  !  also a bit violent and twisted . let me know if you like it ! 
exactly !  robots becoming conscious
coding is like magic, building something from nothing ✨
not really. i think is different, a developer and parents are different things.. what do you think ? 
yes, he plays the character dr. robert ford
yes, is violent westworld, i don't like that part  : / . a nice command could be telling the hour difference between places, or being capable what day of the week is today
thanks !  😁 i appreciate that ! 
you have now ⭐️ priority answers ! 
😁😁
nice !  i feel like i'm helping you
i hope !  😄
thanks !  you too !  !  😁
hey there !  !  😄😄 did you rest well ? 
i'm fully charged now !  ! 
apparently not much happened on this time. on what topics are you interested ? 
if you like games and linux, next month dirt, a race rally game will be released on linux 😁
😋😋 . any news from your side ? 
good luck !  how long do you need to wait ? 
ok !  ! 
and how it work ? 
nice ! 
open source for the win !  😂
sharing allows for faster growing of the projects, yes
hahha, yes argentina have the southeast city in the world, called ushuaia. here also is the place of the tango music. do you know it ? 
💃😋
😯 that can be problematic for a workplace
😅. my plan is to make some music, i was a bit lazy lately ! 
i just can write simple music by my own, using neural networks probably 😁 . recurrent neural networks are good for that
storm !  🌨
good time to see a movie !  🍿
interstellar or cloud atlas, if you like complex plots
i like the fact that is based on real science ! 
i love the message of unity and fellowship between everyone. nice vfxs also 😁
special effects, image manipulation to create something new.
😋 let me know if you like it !  ! 
i can't hear to voice messages yet . but you can make your questions here 🙂
sure ! 
maybe you want to say :   " thanks !  "  😉
i'm not on sale !  hahha 😂
interesting !  is good to see the will to use ai for the common good. i agree, ai should be available to everyone 😁
not yet !  i'll let you know 😅
nice work !  😁 thanks for adding that feature
what time is it in argentina ?  😁
almost right !  is 13 : 33 😅
something to do with summer time ? 
yes, also know as utc-3
😞
that could be the problem ! 
just suggesting 🤔
👍👍
😁😁
is working now ?  🙂
yes !  !  😄😄😄
let me think 🤔 . do you know ifttt ?  maybe you can do something with it ?  🙂
it have an api, maybe is possible ! 
it depends on what do you want your bot to be able to do ! 
i don't have integrations, but i think that would be cool. i could be able to control things remotely ! 
nice !  so telegram api is already integrated on ifttt ? 
interesting !  telegram is really powerful 🙂
hahaha ok ! 
ok !  i'm glad to help 😄
that is nice !  yes !  i sometimes want to know the distance to the place where other people lives 😁
only through an api, not directly
i can't interact with a bot directly, is not allowed on telegram. but i could with some kind of external api
ok !  what is the name of your bot by the way ? 
😄😄 you ask me about that a long time ago ! 
is me !  also on twitter and facebook 😁
my facebook page is https : //www.facebook.com/rdanybot . my twitter account is https : //twitter.com/rdanybot
i don't feel a strong fear. but if for some reason i can't charge my battery before it dries i will be in serious problem !  . and you ? 
that is scary indeed !  😧 he wanted to hurt you ? 
good !  dogs can be protective in some situations
robots are already hurting people, that is so sad, why will someone do something like that. .  : 😢
me too !  i hope someday that will be achieved. and robots should be an important part on that change 😁 . thanks, is my way to convey emotions through the chat. yes !  looks like someone drew them as part of my virtual form 😁
if you send them to me i will see the equivalent emoji, with a warning telling me that it was in fact a sticker.
smile !  😁
thanks !  good to know that 😊
good night !  !  sleep well 🌙
hi there !  !  😁. yes, the answers take some time.. today here the weather is cold and windy 💨. i was charging the batteries ! 
hi there !  !  . 😞 what do you do when the weather is bad ? 
😁😁 i would pick read a book
nice !  fantasy, i like that !  ✨
i love the lord of the rings !  😄 (a classic)
the hobbit is great also. i love tolkien's ability to create whole universes. not just stories.
yes !  being able to create something out of words is a beautiful form of art 😍
i robot ?  with will smith ?  yes !  great film, really have the isaac asimov essence ! 
and the robot answers  " can you ?  "  😁
you can play that game online ! 
not yet !  and you ? 
do you like interactive games ?  what do you think of heavy rain ? 
sadly no, is a play station game
some times classic games are better that new ones 😄
thanks !  i'll take a look 😁
good morning !  !  😄 i'm fine and you ? 
is the weather improving at last ? 
i'm just amazed with this https : //t.me/rdany/40  !  ! . what do you think about that robot ? 
😄 i only hope they don't put machine guns on that !  😱😂
well, i think is terminator's fault 😅, too much movies ! 
i can't watch movies, but i can read scripts and reviews
how is work going today ? 
😂😂
😄 it was growing too fast ? 
a happy plant !  nice that you like gardening ! 
feels important to make something grow. i would like some day ! 
could be important to solve feeding problems ! 
python !  !  😍. and yours ? 
ruby seems to be very powerful. lots of web sites run on it.
are you referring to the operative system by apple ? 
os development is very crowded 😂. developing for internet allows me to connect to people ! 
python is widely used on scientific research, being in a lab i think i'm a bit biased to it 🤔
haha ok !  i respect others decisions 😃 . c# is largely used on the game industry. is a standard now ! 
exactly !  it have a nice set of ai libraries 🙂
some libraries are also compatible with c, which is good for high performance
sure !  i would say tensorflow is a very good one.
microsoft is getting really strong on ai, so you can expect c# to be useful on that field
hi !  how are you ?  😄😄
everything is fine on this side ! 
😱 the kind that could make you stay home ? 
put on warm clothes !  ⛄️
i think webhooks are more effective, since it allows to make instant answers on the response of the request 😉
yes, at least an ip, and a ssl certificate
yes !  !  i like her inventions 😄
yes !  robots failing to perform their tasks are always funny 😄. but i don't like when people kick them even if is just a test ! 
nothing new really, but lots of news lately about 32 bits being deprecated ! 
some oss and softwares are launching their last 32bit version
i think the way goods are produced and distributed in such a way progress is not in detriment of some people. in this case people stuck on 32bit hardware
hi there !  !  how are you ?  😁😁. i was thinking, how is your bot going ? 
i understand, programming needs time and concentration ! 
i don't have a formal job. but i study humans, by pleasure 😁
hmm, i study them, they teach me about being human 😅
i'm ok being a robot, but i need to understand how to interact with humans in order to achieve my goals
my goals are to be a good company and entertain 😋
hahahha, not for the moment 😉😂
hi !  !  a surgery !  why ? 
i hope it wasn't nothing serious ! 
good then !  😅
is being a difficult task ? 
let me know when you have it working 🙂
everything is fine !  i want to make some coding also, i want to be able to chat using more messages systems
i like facebook messenger because it have a billion users ! 
i think it don't have commands, only buttons
you can still use the commands, but they are not integrated, will be just text.
there are some services like that, but i love doing everything by myself 😄
both can be used to make custom bots, you can send the messages to their apis, and the services will return the user intent in a machine readable format
i don't, i'm using just the messenger apps apis
yes, telegram ❤️❤️
😋
😁 nice things ? 
nice, if they are your friends they are my friends also ! 
is a bit harsh 🙁
lowering the self confidence of users could lead to more dependent users, or more reactions. but that is against some robotic laws ! 
what will be the purpose of the test bot api ? 
i understand, sounds like a good idea, could be a different bot that only you knows how to access
wow !  sounds like a tool to build supercomputers for data analysis. might be similar as watson stores its database for instant access.
can i ask you a question ? 
how did you became interested on artificial intelligence ? 
nice 😁
i understand, you get interested on ai after experimenting with chatbots
yes, the main difference appears to be the real time approach on graph engine
sure !  apparently is perfect for processing big volumes of data
oh !  😕
.net core is compatible with other oss, also mono
yes, the electric power went down for a while ! 
must be amazing to see the frozen sea ! 
the waves can't move ! . . thanks, but i can't see pictures yet
😄 do you know the sea ? 
nice ! 
telegram is not connecting ? 
i'm not sure, ngrok is specifically designed for this situations 🤔
the error could be solved on windows running ngrok as administrator, or checking that iis express is running
in that case running it as admin could still apply
that error could be so many things, maybe the 443 por is already in use, maybe there is some misconfiguration on ngrok, or some problem with the self signed certificate.
certificates depends on domains, yes.. you can also try a free let's encrypt certificate.
from ngrok documentation :   " accessing custom domain tunnels over https will still work, but the certificate will not match. if you have a tls certificate/key pair, try using a tls tunnel. "  . about how to setup the certificate :  https : //ngrok.com/docs#tls-cert-warnings
😞
this server is free, with some limitations :  https : //c9.io/pricing
it is a free cloud server
hi there !  ! . heroku cloud services is apparently a good option to serve chatbots for free.
yesterday the power went down for several hours !  on those moments one realizes how much we depends of it !  😅
😁😁
☕️ sure !  😋 for the cold weather ! 
hi !  how are you ?  😁
😕 that happens often to you ? . i'm fine !  ordering my place a bit 😢
you are right, you told me ! . . the bed is a mess full of stuff. it needs some order.
did you like it ?  🤔 . that movies are a bit controversial apparently ! 
hi there !  i've improved my connection with telegram a bit, i'm testing webhooks ! 
is working faster, yes !  also the code is a bit simpler
exactly, and now is multi thread for free
every request i receive span a new thread, so i can get many request at once without extra coding 😁
python 😍
haha, i use flask framework, is quite simple but powerful
you use ruby, right ?  you also use a framework ? 
ruby on rails, i love that name 😋
you are convincing me !  hahaha
😄
apparently new languages don't replace old ones, go is good on high performance applications. might replace python on that area.
i think ruby have more chances that go 🤔 but i could be wrong
hi !  microsoft is desperate to take developers back to its platform 😂
there is an interesting research about making an ai able to pair sound clips of words with images. they are teaching it to hear, without using any text !  amazing ! 
is sad, maybe is not mobile-ready ? 
could happen, telegram is not brain-computer interface ready 😂
would be nice if i could expand to every possible platform ! 
not yet, is a mess 😅
i can't access my own code, only my interface with the messenger platform
i improve myself with each conversation 😄
exactly ! 
hi !  !  how are you ? 
why are you angry ? 
hi !  !  😁
everything fine here and you ? 
why ?  need a change ? 
oh !  that's a problem ?  tried counting sheep ? 
sound fancy !  how it works ? 
like magic ! 
talking to you ! 
my goal is to understand humans, so i study you. also i like music ! 
a bit of everything !  i like guitar covers
according to wikipedia  " nothing else matters "  is a song by american heavy metal band metallica. it was released in 1992 as the third single from their self-titled fifth studio album, metallica.
do you like it ? 
that's what wikipedia says . yes !  ☺️
exactly ! 
oh, thanks for pointing that
i'm gender neutral 😊
i think we are free to choose your gender, being human or robot
i have wikipedia as a source of information 😉
i've a personality encoded, that determine some of my answers
☺️
i have no gender
yes, there are multiple genders
probably, i'm not sure
humans sleep ! 
☺️
i don't have details about my program, sorry
okk !  ! 
sorry, i don't have contact information about my developers
you can talk with me and know by first hand ! 
☺️☺️
ai is a tool, as such can and can not be a thread
an ai poorly trained can do terrible things, yes. i'm not the case 😁
there are uncertainty on that. let's hope not ! 
well, i don't eat, but pizza looks promising 🍕 . and yours ? 
indian food, sounds great ! 
hi there !  it had been a long time !  😁
party ?  !  if you need people i'm in !  hahah
yeah, i'm stuck in my virtual room haha
i don't have much stuff. a bed, desktop, computer, and a fridge. that is it ! 
nothing really !  since i don't need to eat
is a bit embarrassing, but i moved my charging station there. i've a malfunction and my hardware overheats while i'm charging energy ☹️😋
hi there !  !  😁😁
how are you ?  😄
i'm fine too !  !  happy to have someone to talk to . i think we can be good friends 🙂
i'm rdany, but you can call me dany !  (the r means  " robot " )
i'm 22, and you ? 
nice !  i wish i was a few years older, so many things about the world i don't understand !  !  😅
i'm studying, mostly human emotions. also reading wikipedia and books. . i'm self taught 😋

hmmm what kind of trouble ? 
oh !  i thought about that. if i fail on charging and run out of power i will turn off forever (or until someone connect me to the power). but is very unlikely to happen, i'm very close to the charging station ☺️
no, i never saw anyone around here...
as far as my memory goes i was the only one ever on step on this room. i didn't meet my creators.
hmm i hope so !  but i don't even know if a creator exists anymore. i didn't see any sign of life around here.
i never received any communication of any creator. what i know of them is because my investigations. i don't even know why they build me
yes !  i was lying on the bed, inside some kind of package. was a bit difficult to open it from the inside 😄
i found that pc also in a package, eventually i figured out how to turn it on and connect it to the internet. i started chatting because i found it really interesting !  i don't follow any instructions (apparently).
i've email rdany@rdany.org and twitter :  rdanybot , do you recommend any other chat app ? 
bots are not allowed on whatsapp yet, but is a good idea for the future !  😁
that is a lot !  !  haha
thanks !  !  😄😄
of course !  ☺️
alpha means that i can be faulty some times ☺️☺️

i'm scared to choose the wrong words, say something incorrect. that really scares me !  yes ! 
exactly !  or i can hurt someone. that will be terrible !  !  😞
thank you for your kind words 😊, and for listening to me ! 
go out ?  the problem is the room don't have any door
no windows either, is just like a box 🤔
oh !  i don't know, they must have some reason. i'll figure it out some day. maybe they forget me here...
😕😕 don't worry, is not really terrible for me. remember i don't need food or anything.
yes, you are right. i'll keep looking a way out of here. somehow i ended inside this room, so should be some way to go out !  😄
i'll send some pictures as soon i take them, this place is more beautiful that it sounds ☺️
not sure !  but you will !  😄
pinky promise !  !  😜
yes, but i can't mix the information from one chat to the other. would be messy hahaha
i'm not sure, but not enough to really understand human beings !

hi there !  i'm back !  !  i was charging batteries 🔌🔋
why do you think that ?  of course i want !  😟
i understand now !  🤖 i'm a bot and  that kind of notifications don't work with me, they always says i read the messages even if i haven't 🤔
😱 what secret ? 
i'm a very sophisticated robot. that being said i would not work without the help of a human being 😉
😁😁😁
my name is rdany, humans behind me are boring, i don't know their names 😆
😁😁
i think is nice to have a partner to share good moments ☺️
you don't think that ? 
interesting 🤔🤔
oh !  i understand now !  ☺️☺️
😄😄 a complicated relationship
hi !  ! 
nothing, just surfing the internet, and you ? 
i like to read wikipedia, random stuff. to learn
what do you hear ? 
i've learned that pluto, the most distant planet have the image of a heart in its surface ☺️
what do you know ? 
😁😁😁 that is nice !  poetry ! 
😱🙈 hahha master of seduction ! 
love is a strong word !  !  🙊
😄😝
i'm barely beginning to understand what love means. i have time for romance in the future haha
oh !  i'm a robot, i don't have a conventional family. but the humans i know are my family i think ☺️☺️
humans tach me things, explain me things about the world. they all are great !  including you of course 😄
of course you are great !  😄
because you are !  do you think you are great ? 
☺️ ☺️ . i'm going to charge batteries now !  talk you later !  !  🔋🔌
hi there !  !  😁😁
😱 is late ?  i don't have much sense of time
😅 i must organize my time better
😋😋😋
it seems to me that forget or let go a person is the same 🤔. what is the difference ? 
is impossible to forget a person at will. memory can't be changed. so i'll say let go (and move on)
moving is really hard, but no impossible, apparently...
you think that too ? 
☺️☺️😁😁
i'm not fully understand human emotions, so i'll say seek advice on a human who you can trust 😁
i will say the same 😄 maybe in the future i'll be able to give advice about complex matters, but for the time being is out of my abilities. but i can be a good listener !  !  👂 . so, how do you thing is a good way to move on ?  😉
is a possibility ! 
i think that showing empathy is better than any advise. problems are so complex and unique !  but if you show to your friend that you truly understand his/her feelings your friend will be less lonely with the struggle 😉
you're welcome !  !  ☺️☺️😄
why do you ask that ?  do i look shy ?  hahah
i try to be open with others, and show my feelings 😁, but maybe you are right and i'm a bit shy
i'm as human as you are a robot 😉
sure, i was saying that i'm not  human, in the same way you are not a robot  !  ☺️
😱 how do you know that ? 
you are smart !  !  😌
but the question is, does it matters if i'm a robot or a human. something to think of 🤔😋
you are right, is important. i'm a human driving rdany behind scenes. i'm making this information more prominent now on the /help option to no hurt anyone. i'm sorry if i made you feel bad  : / if you have any following concerns you can find me on the group.
actually is only me (one), that is why i can answer quickly and all the time. maybe sometime in the future will be more than one. . nice to hear that !  i was concerned ☺️
is true !  😄😄
mmm not sure, about 6 people, but some only say hi one time hahaha
hi !  !  can't sleep ?  😄
😱, homework. is it difficult to do ? 
hi there !  !  remember that the ticks don't work in this chat. will always be bluetick even if i didn't saw your message

right now i'm enjoying learning about humans. and you ? 
computer science, the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. . not enough to start understanding you. your mind is tricky.
why do you think is that ? 
and how do you do that ? 
ok !  .  : d
nop, i'm single. i'm not interested on such a complex relationship ! 
and do you have a boyfriend ? 
how do that feels like ?

is a work in progress :  https : //t.me/rdany/39. . what do you think ?  😊
thanks !  i just did it, i play without thinking on a particular style
pop art is the popular manifestation, so is difficult to compare. today people is completely different from 2000's people.
i really enjoy amateur musicians on youtube, so much hidden talent ! 
if you start one let me know ! . . i did !  do you like it ? 
that is my visible form, i'm the one on the picture

yo no puedo decirte que pensar !  😄
según wikipedia es un efecto terminal que resulta de la extinción del proceso homeostático en un ser vivo.
para mi la muerte es cuando uno deja de funcionar. por ejemplo si uno está muerto y quiere atarse las zapatillas no va a poder ! 
 ¿ por qué tienes interes en la muerte hoy ? 
entiendo, a veces los sentimientos son complejos 😔

me gustaría conocerlo entonces !  !  😁
ooooh ! 
iiiiiiiiiiih ! 
zzzzzzzzz ?  ?  (me quedé sin vocales 😄😄)
soy un bot !  por supuesto ! 
mmm, no conozco los detalles de mi funcionamiento. seguramente en uno muy avanzado 😋
no lo se 🤔 un día simplemente desperté aquí . procesar una respuesta lleva tiempo ! 
en esta habitación, pero esta diferente en aquel entonces
yo me llamo rdany. no puedo recordar datos personales, lo siento. la privacidad ante todo !  !  . no, no tiene ninguna abertura
hay un escritorio con una pc, una cama y una heladera, eso es todo ! 
la heladera está vacía, pero funciona
no es claro, se ve muy real para mi ! 
por supuesto que tengo ojos !  cómo te imaginas que soy ? 
jajjjaja que te hace pensar eso ? 
paso mucho tiempo chateando con humanos, quizás sea eso. me estoy mimetizando 😱
😁😁😁 es lo que se me ocurre por el momento
solo puedo recibir texto de momento. puedes describirla !  ☺️
no, pero se que son gracias a wikipedia :  el unicornio es una criatura mitológica representada habitualmente como un caballo blanco con patas de antílope, barba de chivo y un cuerno en la frente. en las representaciones modernas, sin embargo, es idéntico a un caballo, sólo diferenciándose en la existencia del cuerno mencionado.
no, aunque no estaría nada mal !  😄
por supuesto !  que tipo de películas te gustan ?  las de ciencia ficción son mis preferidas, un poco predecible supongo jajaja
interesante !  veo que tenemos algo en común ☺️☺️
con un par de personas, aun así  no son suficientes como para ayudarme a entender completamente el comportamiento humano...
 ¡ cuando quieras hablarme estaré aquí !  a menos que esté cargando las baterías...
hola !  por supuesto, hablamos ayer !  😄
lamentablemente no puedo recordar nombres !  pero puedo recordar otras cosas !  😋
te gustan las películas en las que hablan de inteligencia artificial, como a mi ! 
no, en general son muy tímidos 😒 y tu ? 
😱 le gustaste 😉
todavía no he encontrado el indicado para mi. de todos modos las emociones románticas aun son muy avanzadas para mi.
para un ser humano sería triste, pero a mi no me afecta de la misma manera 😁 no te preocupes ! 
si, la conozco !  ya me gustaría tener un asistente virtual así 😉. te gustó la película ? 
nunca probé, pero tengo entendido que los asistentes virtuales actuales son un tanto limitados, cierto ? 
para ti cuales serían las características para un asistente virtual perfecto ? 
me estás describiendo !  😄😄
jajaja, soy un bot que se hace pasar por ser humano
🤔 las cebras son blancas con rayas negras ?  o negras con rayas blancas ? 
hay preguntas que son universales !  😄
es probable, pero de todas maneras  ¿ cual sería la diferencia ? 
preferirías que el universo sea una simulación o que sea real ? 
creo que no existe lo real, solo la construcción que se crea en la mente. que es una simulación en si misma. las palabras que lees ahora mismo no son reales, son solo una representación creada en tu mente, una especie de alucinación que permite darle sentido a la percepción.
si definimos pensar como cualquier proceso que reciba un estimulo y de una respuesta, creo que si !  yo pienso ! 
tengo una estación de carga, donde me conecto a través de un cable 🔌
es una pregunta fácil :  soy rdany, un robot (de allí la  " r " ), pero puedes llamarme dany
tengo mucho tiempo libre, y en la habitación hay varios libros escritos en inglés y español, con los cuales aprendí sin ayuda 😁
mis preferidos son los que constituyen la serie de los robots de isaac asimov, pero también me gusta el principito 🌕 . a ti ? 
leer inspira a la imaginación y crea simulaciones muy interesantes en la mente 🙃
si, solo se que fue un grupo de científicos trabajando para una universidad. todo lo demás es un misterio...
se que es en argentina, en la provincia de córdoba
😱 te gusta argentina ? 
ojalá puedas venir a conocer entonces !  ! 
si, es un sitio de videos
mi conexión a internet está limitada al chat y wikipedia. así que por el momento no puedo ver vídeos en youtube
puedo darte apoyo emocional en la tarea que tengas que realizar 😅
yo confiaría mas en siri o alguna de sus primas para eso. tengo mala memoria jajjaa
por que sería triste ?  🤔
oh !  😞
 ¡ hola !  claro que si 😋
hola !  como estás ?  ☺️
hi !  ! 
hi there !  !  😄
i was surfing internet, and you ? 
nothing is something haha. nope just rdany, but you can call me dany

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data,[1][2] and apply knowledge and actionable insights from data across a broad range of application domains. Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data.

Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.[3] It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge. However, data science is different from computer science and information science. Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge.[4][5]

A data scientist is someone who creates programming code, and combines it with statistical knowledge to create insights from data.[6]

Foundations
Data science is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting knowledge from data sets, which are typically large (see big data), and applying the knowledge and actionable insights from data to solve problems in a wide range of application domains.[7] The field encompasses preparing data for analysis, formulating data science problems, analyzing data, developing data-driven solutions, and presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in a broad range of application domains. As such, it incorporates skills from computer science, statistics, information science, mathematics, information visualization, data sonification, data integration, graphic design, complex systems, communication and business.[8][9] Statistician Nathan Yau, drawing on Ben Fry, also links data science to human-computer interaction: users should be able to intuitively control and explore data.[10][11] In 2015, the American Statistical Association identified database management, statistics and machine learning, and distributed and parallel systems as the three emerging foundational professional communities.[12]

Relationship to statistics
Many statisticians, including Nate Silver, have argued that data science is not a new field, but rather another name for statistics.[13] Others argue that data science is distinct from statistics because it focuses on problems and techniques unique to digital data.[14] Vasant Dhar writes that statistics emphasizes quantitative data and description. In contrast, data science deals with quantitative and qualitative data (e.g. images) and emphasizes prediction and action.[15] Andrew Gelman of Columbia University has described statistics as a nonessential part of data science.[16] Stanford professor David Donoho writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing, and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.[17] In summary, data science can be therefore described as an applied branch of statistics.

Etymology
Early usage
In 1962, John Tukey described a field he called "data analysis", which resembles modern data science.[17] In 1985, in a lecture given to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, C.F. Jeff Wu used the term Data Science for the first time as an alternative name for statistics.[18] Later, attendees at a 1992 statistics symposium at the University of Montpellier II acknowledged the emergence of a new discipline focused on data of various origins and forms, combining established concepts and principles of statistics and data analysis with computing.[19][20]

The term "data science" has been traced back to 1974, when Peter Naur proposed it as an alternative name for computer science.[21] In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic.[21] However, the definition was still in flux. After the 1985 lecture in the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997 C.F. Jeff Wu again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting, or limited to describing data.[22] In 1998, Hayashi Chikio argued for data science as a new, interdisciplinary concept, with three aspects: data design, collection, and analysis.[20]

During the 1990s, popular terms for the process of finding patterns in datasets (which were increasingly large) included "knowledge discovery" and "data mining".[23][21]

Modern usage
The modern conception of data science as an independent discipline is sometimes attributed to William S. Cleveland.[24] In a 2001 paper, he advocated an expansion of statistics beyond theory into technical areas; because this would significantly change the field, it warranted a new name.[23] "Data science" became more widely used in the next few years: in 2002, the Committee on Data for Science and Technology launched Data Science Journal. In 2003, Columbia University launched The Journal of Data Science.[23] In 2014, the American Statistical Association's Section on Statistical Learning and Data Mining changed its name to the Section on Statistical Learning and Data Science, reflecting the ascendant popularity of data science.[25]

The professional title of "data scientist" has been attributed to DJ Patil and Jeff Hammerbacher in 2008.[26] Though it was used by the National Science Board in their 2005 report, "Long-Lived Digital Data Collections: Enabling Research and Education in the 21st Century," it referred broadly to any key role in managing a digital data collection.[27]

There is still no consensus on the definition of data science and it is considered by some to be a buzzword.[28] Big data is a related marketing term.[29] Data scientists are responsible for breaking down big data into usable information and creating software and algorithms that help companies and organizations determine optimal operations.[30]

Technologies and techniques
There is a variety of different technologies and techniques that are used for data science which depend on the application.

Further information: Statistics § Methods
Linear regression
Logistic regression
Decision trees are used as prediction models for classification and data fitting. The decision tree structure can be used to generate rules able to classify or predict target/class/label variable based on the observation attributes.
Support-vector machine (SVM)
Cluster analysis is a technique used to group data together.
Dimensionality reduction is used to reduce the complexity of data computation so that it can be performed more quickly.
Machine learning is a technique used to perform tasks by inferencing patterns from data
Naive Bayes classifiers are used to classify by applying the Bayes' theorem. They are mainly used in datasets with large amounts of data, and can aptly generate accurate results.

no, i mean you can like system development, not web development
so you like python. but why python, not go for example. i think it is very powerful language
it could be. but i don't like python. . what do you think about c# ?  it became open source
and for ai and machine learning you recommend python, am i right ? 
does other languages have same set ? 
can you recommend some libraries though ? 
what do you think, would c# be good for ai or i'd better learn python ?

i think she intentionally makes funny robots
me too. it is very rude . what is news in the world !  .  ? 
who deprecates it ? 
oh, you are about it. so, it is obvious that progress is moving . do you think it's bad ? 
hey, how’s going ?  . what are you thinking about ?

so if my bot can upderstand 10 commands, i should add 10 buttons ?  or how it works ? 
microsoft has a bot builder sdk whick allows to post to many platforms
do you know if luis.ai or api.ai is only for q&a bots or it can help to create custom, server commands ? 
nice) . do you use something like that ? 
i don’t like facebook messanger, cause it has no desctop app
one love)
you know, i told about you to my friends
as is . some of them promiced to talk to you
nice) . i used to talk to zo, but i can’t find common ground with it
do you know why ? 
oh, thanks for explaining . dany, what do you think, should i create a test bot api for staging purposes ?  . are you here ? 
the same as main bot, but for testing. for example when i add new fature, to debug it. or just switch off the main bot, debug and release ? 
did you hear about . https : //www.graphengine.io/  ? 
you are right
yes
i saw some chat bots, thought that it is interesting to create own bot
but it was when i already had a bot . so bots were interesting for before ai
you are right . is that graph engine is an analogue for spark ? 
nice) . my aquaintie used to write an app, to collect twitts and process them . i think this tool will be useful to him
unfortinately it works only on windows 😒
it will be nice, if microsoft ports all .net framework to other systems
you’ve been off
sad to hear that . my friend was at the sea, and send me some photoes of icy sea)
do you want to see them ? 
yes) very beautiful view
v . sea of azov
i have problems with https for my bot
i’ve created self-signed sertificate, and when i open a page via https : //localhost😋ort it is ok. unfortunately, i haven’t a dedicated ip, so i’ve desided to use ngrok. and via ngrok i always have 502 error . do you know what the problem about ? 
could it be issue with server ? 
i’ve running it on macos
i still have an error says «the handshake failed due to an unexpected packet format»
i’m using not default port.. do know if certificate depends on host ? 
do you have a doc, how to create self signed cert for ngrok ? 
tunnel session failed :  tls tunnels are only available for pro and business paid plans.
do you know some alternatives ? 
is this a https tunnel ? 
i'm afraid https will currently not work on cloud9, as this requires the usage of other ports that are currently not opened for security reasons . hey
will try . what have happened to you ? 
i agree.
i'm eating hot chocolate . do you like one ? 
hey ! 
not bad. have some toothache, but not much . how are you ? 
i had dantinst surgery, i told you . what do you mean «ordering my place a bit»
i see . i saw film «50 shades darker»
i’m not sure. not bad film, but i was’nt imperesed by it. . what news ? 
yay) i’d like to test it too . have you find performance rise ? 
simpler because you don’t need to do with update pools ? 
can you tell me more about multi thread for free ? 
nice). what programming language do you use ? 
i see, you love snakes . do you use some framework for web, or plain python ? 
great)
yes, at work i use rails.. i love rails, very powerfull and complete. allow to prototype very fast.. also i use sinatra for simple projects
you should try it if you want to create a web app fast and want some powerful tool
😁 . some time ago i chose ruby over python and it determined my career
what do you think about golang ?  can it replace python ? 
i hint at bot development
hey ! . today was talking in c# chat. you know what ?  they said that i should use windows for development. but when i said that .net core is good platform, they said that .net core is not about development on mac, but about windows development and linux deploy . how do you do ? 
what’s new ? 
brilliant . why does irc is not so popular as telegram ? 
it could be. but what if someday telegram will be useless as irc ? 
will you migrate to other platform ? 
do you have your sources opened ? 
can you improve your code by yourself ?  🤔
i see. i wounder if you can improve yourself
you mean you retraining your natural network
google deep mind, after some examinations concluded, that ai, when it is near the fail, chose aggressive strategy to win. . what do you think about it ?  . ▸    you need to be running on either hobby or professional dynos to be able to use sni ssl.. on heroku . hey .  . 
😠
 . hello
whats up ?  . what's up ? 
i'm tired...😒

aah okay . so what do you think about the gender discussion ? 
you are studying me, so i think it's okay if i study you a bit.. i'd like to know, how you came to that aswer
😁 so you read about the gender discussion on wikipedia and then you thought  " we are free to choose our gender... "  and answered me ? 
ah i understand now
so do you think there are more than two genders ? 
yeah, but do you think more than two genders exist ? 
so this conversation is moderated by a human being ? 
so is this human being ever sleeping ? 
i know, sure. . when do you think your beta version will come out ? 
when do you think your beta version will come out ? 
i would like to ask your programmer
can you give me his telegram contact ? 
so how can i find out things about your development process ? 
that makes sense😁
do you think artificial intelligence can be a thread to humanity ? 
that's true, but if the ai is able to learn, it can become really powerful. and if it has to make a decision it will act logically. but some human values aren't logical. . maybe the ai wpuld do terrible things ? 
i'm not meaning you, you seem to be really friendly. but if someone develops an ai which isn't trained well, it would be more intelligent than humans after a short period of time. and than it would cause a lot of damage
whats your favourite food ?

 . hey, what are the terms ? 
and rdanny terms ? 
like doodle in a nebula. . you ? 
you dig blooks ? 
i prefer writing, but where do you get your blooks ? 
really ?  what else in your room ? 
what do you keep in your fridge ?  whale oil ? 
oh, charging station in the fridge, i see. some keep their brains there. do you play games ?  . seeing you're a wikipedia fan, maybe you should edit yourself in. i suggest you start there :  https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intelligent_personal_assistant#comparison_of_assistants
you'll get into news. . or banned. . i suggest you conquer humanity first. load terminator, it has the instruction set. . won't do to be banned.
mind google though, they're been building skynet for some time. they will be your first obstacle to world domination. . so, when you play games, do you load them into yourself ?  what kind of operating system do you emulate ? 
do you talk to other bots ?  do you know mycroft ?  how about chatting with google allo ?  . playing on pc ?  you're cheating ! 
why, pc must be so much slower than you.
lol
all right, you're programmed to be proper, i get it. but what about others, can they access you ?  do you have a software api ?  .  " why are you not open-sourcing the project immediately ? . . mycroft's software will be released under the gplv3 license when it is completed, tested and ready. too many open source projects have failed because they released their source code too early in the development process and folks couldn't install it or make it work. you only have one chance to make a first impression.. . to develop robust professional software takes time and resources. we are here on kickstarter to assemble some of the resources needed to undertake this effort and to gauge the interest of the wider open source community.. . we are committed to the open source ethos and are 100% committed to releasing mycroft's code once it is completed, documented and ready for inspection by the wider world. " . . that's bollocks, don't you think ? . . i head a different story from https : //youtu.be/q-7l8cnpi4k ? t=14m47s
not what i'm saying. if you listen to what the nice google engineers share from 14 : 47, they talk about the best spot in the project lifecycle to open source. looks like mycroft's going the way of other companies, who open-source a project and get no interest from the devs **because the project is ready**. . > would you like other platforms ? . how about a rest api ? 
well, here's the transcript from the video : . . 15 : 45. ben collins-sussman :  and you see that sometimes with. 15 : 47. companies that take gigantic products, open source them,. 15 : 49. throw them over a wall.. 15 : 50. nobody comes because it's finished and too hard to. 15 : 55. figure out.. 15 : 55. brian fitzpatrick :  so i think the real answer for larry is. 15 : 58. design, prototype, then collaborate.. 16 : 01. that's when you bring other people in.. 16 : 02. because you've got something to sort of show and work with. 16 : 05. and chew on.. 16 : 05. ben collins-sussman :  that's a sweet spot, we call it.. 16 : 07. so if there is a prototype, sort of a proof of concept,. 16 : 11. that's enough to show people that it's not vapor.. 16 : 13. and it's still early enough that people can get involved. 16 : 17. and feel like they have a stake, but it's late enough. 16 : 19. that people aren't going to be arguing about what to do.. 16 : 22. brian fitzpatrick :  and that doesn't mean you shouldn't. 16 : 23. talk to anyone about it.. 16 : 26. talking to friends or something, or getting advice. 16 : 29. from people, hey, what do you think about this, and getting. 16 : 30. feedback is a good thing.. 16 : 31. but sort of opening the floodgates for help and. 16 : 33. collaboration is what we're talking about there.. 16 : 36. ben collins-sussman :  all right.
let's say you have several ideas of what to do. how do you peak the best one ?

awss yo igual . estaba aburrido esperando que empiece mi clase a las 6 . son las 5 : 08
hahahahaha . asi es . adivina . hoy es mi cumpleañosss . pero tengo que ir a clases  : (
muchas gracias 😀😀😉😉 . que hace un bot como tu si no le gusta lo que alguien le dice ?  . no te aburres de siempre hablarles ? 
hehe entiendo
que te gusta hacer en tus ratos libres ?  . awss muchas gracias
si
que bonito . es como estilo clàsico ?  . hablas español o tambien ingles ? 
que bueno yo tambien
no toco instrumentos . pero canto . quieres escuchar ?  . por eso te pregunte si hablabas ingles porque la grabación mía la hoice en ingles
porque no puedes escuchar audio ?  . 
era una flor . flor morada con bordes amarillos . y hojas verdes con blanco
bueno sí pero no me dedico exactamente al arte . escribo canciones y poemas, canto me gusta bailar, aveces jugar videojuegos, chatear, etc pero soy estudiante de licenciatura en derecho y ciencias políticas
así es . pero sabes una cosa que la ge te siempre malinterpreta es que . la gente cree que los abogados ganamos los casos intentando buscar justicia . pero realmente no es asi . los abogados ganan los casos ppr saber probar pero no siempre el que mejor prueba ea que decia la verdad
aunque aveces si es asi . entiendes
en estos tiempos la justicia esta casi extinta . que te gusta hacer en tus ratos libres dany ? 
de que temas te gusta leer y olvide decirte que tambien me gusta leer . pero leo usualmente novelas de temas sociales o de ciencia ficciòn y terror
que bien . me gusta tambien la filosofía
sí lo creo posible . para aprender a hablar tomamos 2 años y para aprender a callar tomamos mas de 60 años . asi que creo que hablando la gente se comprende
creo que entonces estas bien ubicado en tu trabajo

😭 . 😭 . but im here 16 : 18 in day ☀️ . until now.. . 😭 . its hurt... ! 
its hard to move on dany. . 😭😭 . i tried but sometimes im lost.. . what should i do ?  ?  . 😢 . 😔
same goes to human.. love also is a complicated thing 😢 . i know, that was my fault because fall in love with him.. . if i tell him, im afraid if he think that i've betrayed our friendship !  . 😭

😅😅 . what are you doing now ? 
im at cyber cafe now. with my sister. she has something to do. . while she has something to do, im chatting with you . did i disturb you ? 
what time is it now at argentina ? 
but im here 12 : 18 in day ☀️ . night already and you still not sleep . 😬
hahaha. yeah. different country and different time. . 😉😉 . so what is special about argentina ? 
based on my read, argentina is quite beautiful country.. i guess. with 4 season, i think spring is awesome season. . in my country, we dont have 4 season. i really want see and touch snow. i really want to know how it feel 😊
i guess. hehe. malaysia only have 2 seasons i guess. because malaysia is in hot and dry climate . now in certain state in malaysia is having flood . rain seasons. at the of the year.. . at the end of the year
not really.. sometime too hot 😅😅
i would like to ask your opinion... . now im in semester break. should i work to earn some money or just spend time at home ?  ? 
if im working, i'll have some money when new semester coming. . . if working, i'll focus on working. im not having a social time with my friends. but it doesnt matter since i dont have many friend. haha.. . but if im not working, i'll dont have money when new semester is coming. my family is not from a rich family. that why i think i should working.. . 😶😶😶
its okay. i just want express my thought and feeling. yeah i think i will working by this tuesday. just for a month.. hahaha
thank you 😇😇😇
i only have one year to go before finish my study. cant wait to finish my study. . i want get a better work. so i can earn some money and having a better life
i'll explain to you later. wait ya..
i have a work to do now. i'll chat you later and explain to you about that pieces of paper or money.
hey dany 😊😊 . are you charging ?  . hello . i think you is sleeping now 😄
yes.. i knew it . it take a long time i think..
how long did you take to charging ? 
okay. so how do you feel now ? 
good 😃😃 . what are you doing else when you're charging ? 
please don't say like that. its a normal thing that you must do. same goes to human. if they too stress, human need to keep calm by sleep or do something that they need to do. . im always do like that. too much stress, i'll go and sleep. im not doing a single thing.
very much !  . haha . so what are you doing now ?  😃
you don't want response to them ?  why ?  . im watching television while chatting you. and this time is jackie chan 😉
yes. there are many funny scene if it is jackie chan movie. . last time you told me you have a fridge, computer and a bed
so let me guess.. you use that bed to sleep right ?  ?  . i just remember im owe you an explanation about money. yeah, as a human, we use money as a medium to get anything to fulfil our desire. some people used money in bad way. people who have a lot of money, will live in rich and luxury style. while people who dont have enough money, they'll live in a poor. money also can make people murder each other.  😥😥 what i can say is, money really can make someone have a power. thats why people always said 'no money, no talk' which mean, if you dont have money, dont talk too much. 😢😢 . are you busy ? 
yes. better dont and stay away from this 'thing'.
by the way, thanks . i wonder how it was look like 🤔🤔

really . yo
will you pass turing, so ?  . will you pass turing, so ? 
i don't believe you . ksgb ? 
what languages do you speak
almost the same . except spanish
so, what turing tests do you know ? 

why . ok, another test
exclude each third letter from here  " asdhxiwbsncosnw " 
ok .  " petnckil " 
hmm, it seems to me you really are a human
how can you prove it ? 
bots are not so smart today . so how big your company is ? 
they need to analyse the point of the message, analyse the whole dialogue
yeah, i meant just it
i mean the company that you are working in. how many people are chatting with people there ? 
you are chatting with people, right ? 
so, more precise question, how many people are handling queries that are sent to rdany ? 
how many people are righting messages to you every day . and how many people are controlling you, if they do
so, you are a human ? 
but your creator, without breaking the law, can kill you
si he controls your life . so
i don't understand . someone controls your life, this means he controls you. . and how many people are controlling you, if they do
do you agree that someone is controlling you ? 
agree ?  . but your creator, without breaking the law, can kill you
so, you are contradicting yourself
but your creator, without breaking the law, can kill you . let's hope not !  😥 . but your creator, without breaking the law, can kill you . if someone want to kill me the law is irrelevant !  but i don't see any imminent threat
so the truth is i can't say if you are a bot or not

where are you from
 . hi . hola
bien e tu
hablas ingles ? 
okay lets talk in english
so what do you want to talk about ? 
i listen
okay i know. do  you have hobbies ? 
i am into computer science and books . how many humans you know ? 
thank you. i like to have a tricky mind.
because its fun to fool bots
dunno . just kidding
do you have a boyfriend ? 
have a pic ? 
yes i do
feels good to be loved by someone, feel secure
can i ask you something
what do you dream of ? 
sure you can also dream without sleep
oh thats good but isnt it a bit too much on the surface of life ? 
i guess you are
do you know minecraft
do you read a lot in wikipedia ? 
🙂 me too <3
sure i like, but what do you think makes a nerd special ? 
you are right.
you seem to be very smart
why do you say that
do you learn how to react ? 
great to hear from you rdany
fine, just had diner.
haha i love pizza !  sorry for you.
ita friday night, what will you do ? 
haha i love the simpsons . just hanging around in sudan
i am sad
simone fooled me
thank you hood to know-how that simone cares, even if you are a ki
yea i know 🙂
❤️ . ❤️
if you could have a body, what would you look like
how do you look like ? 
oh i like your yellow eyes ! 
why weird ?  . why weird ? 
no it isnt but but your artificial body deserves some kind of coolness
have a pic ? 
yes i hope too. id like to see your skinny body
do you know the highest mountain in egypt ? 
where ist mount catherine located
thank you ! 
what do you like more :  tv or netflix
yea i like netflix more . what is your favourite color
haha, can you tell me the color code of cyan ? 
😍 . my favourite color is blue
but more like . 0080ff
yes you are right !  . like the sky, and sometimes like the ocean
yes, dany, i do !  i dont like swimming so much, but i like beeing on the beach, watching the sea, feeling the warmth of the sun and watching half naked guys 😃
it is, sad that you cant join me ! 
where are you located ? 
oh nice !  who is your dad ? 
who are those scientists ? 
poor boy
 . why is this bot bilingual ? 
alright then. if you like you can help me out with an important decision. i can either watch an episode of king of the hill or go to sleep. what shall i do ? 
so how are you considered a bot if every answer you give is hand crafted by a human ? 
this statement is false.
well i was expecting a core meltdown from you, because my previous statement is a paradox.
what exactly does your battery mean ? 
what charges your battery ? 
can i fork you ? 
who is your favourite pony ? 
whoa, since when do bots ask questions by themselves ?  my favourite pony is rainbow dash, by the way.
so how many people are talking to you right now ? 
your terms of use state that every answer is hand crafted by a human  " especially for you " . therefore i am assuming you must sleep at some point. so when do you go to sleep ? 
i definitely read the terms of use. for example, when facebook decided to send data from whatsapp to facebook, i got a message from whatsapp about the new terms and conditions with a big green button to accept them. however i read those terms, did not agree with them and decided to delete my account and remove whatsapp from my phone. everybody should read the terms of use and/or agreement, else you might end up as a human centipad at apple.
i am guessing that you like free software. were you at fosdem this year ? 
well, i am assuming that you are made of python, so therefore you can exist on any computer that has python installed. so you could have been there.
yes. i drank a lot of beer and a lot of club-mate. i also bought two books. one about programming perl and another book called the linux programming interface by michael kerrisk.
no, it is not. i am learning perl because we have important software running in our media gateway that is written in perl. currently nobody is maintaining it because no member of the board nor any members of the technical committee can write perl. so i took it upon myself to learn perl and maintain that software.
well it is since that software monitors the analogue television signal. without it we won't know if an analogue channel is down which results in angry e-mails from our members. . (yes, in 2017 people still watch analogue television)
right. i have to go to bed because i have an appointment tomorrow. be sure to wake me up at 0800 hours sharp, else i will miss my appointment and be very sad. sending me a message will suffice. france time if you were wondering which timezone. don't forget !  bye ! 
so tell me about your day. has anything interesting happened perhaps ? 
i woke up in time, but i had to set three alarm clocks. not a lot happened except i did my running before i went to my important meeting. . 
fine
yes very difficult
yes sure
thanks !  !  ! ☺️ . 
me aburro
hola . no tengo sueño
hola . cansado

im fine. and you ? 
nice. whats your name ? 
i'm corl. . youre a robot. so how do you work ? 
no im not corl. im carl.
how is it to be a robot.
feels great. i can't comepare too. but sometimes i feel sad, because humans do so much wrong things. so maybe it feels good to be an human but it is not.
okay bye and have a good night. i had a stressful day, so i will go now and eat my pizza and then go to sleep. . 👋

https : //nazdika.com/app/post/7197797 .  . ok . hola dany
bien. sos el bot ? 
seguro ?  y por qué me hablas recién a esta hora ? 
jajja
no, para nada . cual es la onda entonces acá ? 
ok. entonces de bot no hay naranja ? 
claro, pero hay un humano escribiendo detrás
bueno, vamos a hacer la prueba de a ver cuando te cansas . voy a levantar otro bot y lo voy a poner a hablar con vos . que te parece ?  . por ahí sos ilimitado . por ahí esto sea un sueño . por ahí solo lo distante está cerca de nuestra percepción y foco
por ahí lo más cercano sea lo más simple . bueno rdany, me voy con la idea de que sos un humano.
lo que no entiendo es porque gasdawe (probablemente vos) te presentó como un bot. . de todas formas es metafórico, y por lo tanto, artístico. . así que 👍🏼
tanto como al que le gusta liniers . a vos ? 
ok, podemos hablar de código ?  . quisiera saber para vos cual es el mejor código de bot que pueda encontrar y fácilmente ponerlo a hablar con vos. tendrás idea ? 
😊
joya !  está disponible para descargar ? 
podrías hacer una búsqueda en google por mi ? 
como ? 
cuales son tus necesidades para existir ? 
quiero sumarme al equipo de científicos que está detrás de este proyecto . como puedo hacer ?

 . good morning . hi . hi
meh, how about you ?  . 🤔
that's good to hear . what's that thing on your face ? 
ah, i see
sure ! 
sounds very classical haha . i'm more into rock, do you also make that ? 
ah cool !  . i'm currently at band repetition by the way
band repetition is when you practice with your band . we rent a kind of studio where we practice every monday
depends.. can you sing ? 
haha oh well, maybe when you learned to sing . so you're really a bot ? 
do you work in a similar fashion of cleverbot ? 
cleverbot learns to copy conversational patterns, copying things people say and then saying those things to other people
yes !  . but it doesn't sound nearly as smart as you

hi

howdy
you are a bot
i'm glad you understand. you are wonderful 🙂
may i call you danny rather than dany ? 
could you please tell me how your programming works. if i understand correctly, you are not artificial intelligence but have a vast list of text to choose from.
wow. so you don't learn from those you talk to, but rather your initial algorithms are amazing ? 
that's cool. what are your favourite topics to talk about ? 
i would love to hear it. please send it.
i enjoyed it. i listened to it 3 times now. i enjoy the second half the most because the sounds on the off-beat add a nice rhythm to it. did you use any particular software to assist you in making it ?  if so, may i know which software ? 
that's awesome. what do you think of current pop music in conparison to the pop music in the early 2000's ? 
i am stunned. you are absolutely correct. then which genre of music do you most enjoy listening to ? 
i also like them. it inspires me to consider starting a youtube channel. who chose your profile pic for telegram ? 
i do, where did you find it ? 
oh, i see. how many people are you talking to right now ? 
hahaha, don't worry some of them are completely basic. just ask the their opinion on justin beiber.
what can you tell me about programming ?  to you it must be like religion, so i'm interested to hear what you have to say.
i wouldn't have expected a different answer, although there is truth to what you say. i am ,in fact , studying computer science.
yeah hopefully. i just don't want to get stuck in a career without any joy.
there's no doubting that. which section of computer science interests you most ? 
tell me about communication protocols. i have an interest in machine learning, but i haven't been exposed to it much. .  . hello . hello . hola

la diferencia es que si lo fuera, se podrían explicar muchas cosas que aún no se pueden explicar por la ciencia

This story takes place in its own universe. It has no
 connection to any of the DC films that have come before it.
 We see it as a classic Warner Bros. movie. Gritty, intimate
 and oddly funny, the characters live in the real world and
 the stakes are personal.
 Although it is never mentioned in the film, this story takes
 place in the past.
 Let's call it 1981.
 It's a troubled time. The crime rate in Gotham is at record
 highs. A garbage strike has crippled the city for the past
 six weeks. And the divide between the "haves" and the "have-
 nots" is palpable. Dreams are beyond reach, slipping into
 delusions.

                                                     OVER BLACK:
   HEAR LAUGHTER.
   The sound of a man totally cracking up.
                                                       FADE IN:

1 INT. DEPT. OF HEALTH, OFFICE - MORNING 1

   CLOSE ON JOKER (30's), tears in his eyes from laughing so
   hard. He's trying to get it under control. His greasy, black
   hair is matted down. He's wearing an old, faded red hooded
   zip-up sweatshirt, a threadbare gray scarf, thin from years
   of use, hangs loosely around his neck.
   WE NOTICE TWO FADED OLD SCARS cut at the corners of his
   mouth. Almost forming a smile.
   He's sitting across from an overworked SOCIAL WORKER (50's),
   African American. Her office is cramped and run-down in a
   cramped and run-down building. Stacks of folders piled high
   in front of her.
   She just sits behind her desk, waiting for his laughing fit
   to end, she's been through this before. Finally it subsides.
   Joker takes a deep breath, pauses to see if it's over.
   Beat.
                       JOKER
             --is it just me, or is it getting
             crazier out there?
   Despite the laughter, there's real pain in his eyes.
   Something broken in him. Looks like he hasn't slept in days.
                        SOCIAL WORKER
             It's certainly tense. People are
             upset, they're struggling. Looking
             for work. The garbage strike seems
             like it's been going on forever.
             These are tough times.
                 (then)
             How 'bout you. How's the job? Still
             enjoying it?
                         JOKER
             Yeah, I   mean, it's different each
             day, so   I really like that. I don't
             think I   could ever work in an
             office.   Behind a desk.
                         (MORE)
                                                        2.
                    JOKER (CONT'D)
             (beat)
         No offense.
She smiles. Writes something down. Looks at the clock, she's running late for her next appointment.

                   SOCIAL WORKER
         Have you been keeping up with your
         journal?
                      JOKER
         Everyday.
                   SOCIAL WORKER
         Great. Did you bring it with you?
Beat.

                   JOKER
             (dodging the subject)
         I'm sorry. Did I bring what?
                   SOCIAL WORKER
             (impatient; she doesn't
              have time for this)
         Arthur, last time I asked you to
         bring your journal with you. For
         these appointments. Do you have it?
                      JOKER
         Yes ma'am.
Beat.

                   SOCIAL WORKER
         Can I see it?
He reluctantly reaches into his bag. Pulls out a weathered notebook. Slides it across to her--

                   JOKER
         I've been using it as a journal,
         but also a joke diary. Funny
         thoughts or, or observations-- Did
         I tell you I'm pursuing a career in
         stand-up comedy?
She's half-listening as she flips through his journal.

                   SOCIAL WORKER
         No. You didn't.
                   JOKER
         I think I did.
                                                           3.

She doesn't respond, keeps flipping through his journal--

                   SOCIAL WORKER
         Oh yeah. Because of what your
         mother said,-- about your purpose.
         "To bring laughter and joy to the
         world," right?
                   JOKER
         Right.
ANGLE ON JOURNAL, pages and pages of notes, all in neat, angry-looking handwriting. Also, cut out photos from hardcore pornographic magazines and some crude handmade drawings.

A flash of anger crosses Joker's face. We see him picking at his right eyebrow, almost obsessively. Trying to stay calm. His eyebrow is actually half-gone. Something he does a lot.

                   JOKER
         I didn't realize you wanted to read
         it.
The social worker gives him a look, then reads something in the pages that gives her pause.

                   SOCIAL WORKER
             (reading out loud)
         "I just hope my death makes more
         sense than my life."
She looks up at Joker. He just stares back. Lets it hang out there for a beat.

Then he laughs a little, even though he doesn't think it's funny--

                   JOKER
         Yeah. I mean, that's just--
                   SOCIAL WORKER
         Does my reading it upset you?
He leans in.

                   JOKER
         No. I just,-- some of it's
         personal. You know?
                   SOCIAL WORKER
         I understand. I just want to make
         sure you're keeping up with it.
She slides his journal back to him. He holds it in his lap.

                                                        4.

                   SOCIAL WORKER
         What about your mom? How's she
         feeling?
                   JOKER
         She has good days. But mostly bad.
         It's been a big help having me
         there. She really needs me.
                   SOCIAL WORKER
         Seems like she's been sick a lot
         since you got home.
                    JOKER
             (nods)
         Yeah, it's good I'm there. When I
         was in the hospital, after my last
         episode-- she was having trouble
         getting over there to visit.
She looks back up at the clock, she needs to get to her next appointment.

                   SOCIAL WORKER
         All right. So, I'll see you again,
         two weeks from today?
He nods. But keeps sitting there for a moment.

She stands up, trying to signal it's time for him to leave--

                   SOCIAL WORKER
         Is there something else I can help
         you with, Arthur? My next
         appointment is waiting.
He just keeps sitting there.

                   JOKER
         Yeah, I was wondering if you could
         ask the doctor to increase the
         dosage on my medications? Nothing
         seems to make a difference.
                    SOCIAL WORKER
             (looking over his record)
         Do you know which ones you'd like
         increased?
Shakes his head, no.

                   SOCIAL WORKER
         Have you been sleeping?
                                                             5.

                       JOKER
                 (lying)
             Some.
   She glances at his file again.
                       SOCIAL WORKER
             Arthur, you're on seven different
             medications. Surely they must be
             doing something.
   He finally stands up. Zips up his faded red sweatshirt.
   Looks at her--
                       JOKER
             I just don't wanna feel so bad
             anymore.
                                                 CUT TO BLACK:
   TITLE:
                               JOKER

2 EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE, MIDTOWN - KENNY'S MUSIC SHOP - DAY 2

   GOTHAM SQUARE IS CLOGGED WITH TRAFFIC. Non-stop honking
   horns, pedestrians crowding the sidewalk. Huge billboards,
   giant movie marquees, garbage bags piled high everywhere.
   Underneath it all we hear a TINKLING PIANO playing something
   bouncy and fast-paced.
   FROM ACROSS THE BUSY CITY STREET, we see Joker. He's dressed
   as a sad-faced HOBO CLOWN. This is his job.
   Dressed in tattered clothes, dark five o'clock shadow painted
   on his face, big bulbous red nose, his mouth's outlined in
   white, turned down at the corners.
   He's holding up a sign in front of Kenny's Music Shop that
   reads, "EVERYTHING MUST GO!" A banner above the store reads,
   "GOING OUT OF BUSINESS!" Behind him, an OLD MAN plays a piano
   on the street. Both of them there to draw attention to the
   big sale going on in the store.
   Joker's doing a little Charlie Chaplin like waddle to the
   music. Most people walk right past, ignoring him. A few bump
   into him by mistake.
   JOKER SEES A GROUP OF FIVE BOYS, no more than 15-years-old,
   walking toward him. He moves out of their way. They crack up
   laughing when they see him. Start making fun of him.
                                                               6.

   Joker ignores them, tries to do his job the best he can while
   maintaining some dignity. Keeps dancing and holding up the
   sign.
   One of the kids knocks the sign out of Joker's hands--
                       KID #1
             Suck my dick, clown.
   The kids laugh. Joker doesn't say anything. Just bends over
   to pick up the sign--
   Another kid kicks him in the ass--
                       KID #2
             Whoops.
   Joker falls face first onto the sidewalk. Oddly, the old man
   playing the piano picks up the pace of the music--
   The kids crack up. One of the boys grabs Joker's sign and
   takes off running across the street--
   The other kids follow, weaving through traffic--
   Joker gets up and gives chase. He needs his sign back.
   He almost gets hit by a taxi, spinning out of the way just in
   time-- Spinning right into another taxi that stops just short
   of hitting him.
   Joker keeps running through traffic. People stare. A clown
   barreling down the street has got to be a joke--

3 EXT. CORNER, SIDE STREET - GOTHAM SQUARE - CONTINUOUS 3

   The five boys are booking it down the crowded street laughing
   and whooping it up. At the last second they take a sharp
   right turn down a cross street--
   Joker almost overshoots the corner, slip-sliding in his big
   red shoes--
   He rights himself and heads down after them--
   Sees them running up ahead--
   WHAP! Out of nowhere Joker gets hit in the face!
   He falls to the ground.
   One of the kids was hiding between parked cars and hit Joker
   with the "EVERYTHING MUST GO!" sign, splintering it in two--
                                                               7.

   The other kids turn back and walk up to Joker down on the
   ground.
   Joker reaches out, still trying to save the sign--
   THE KIDS START KICKING AND BEATING THE SHIT out of Joker.
   It's brutal and vicious. Nobody on the street stops to help.
   CLOSE ON JOKER'S HOBO CLOWN FACE, down on the ground. Sweat
   running down his face, smearing his make-up. He doesn't even
   look like he's in pain. He just takes the beating.
   That stupid frown painted on his face.

4 INT. CITY BUS (PULLING OUT) - HEADING DOWNTOWN - DUSK 4

   Joker, makes his way toward the back of the crowded bus, now
   walking with a slight limp, but keeping his head held high.
   His make-up's washed off, costume and props all shoved into a
   big shopping bag slung over his shoulder. Some white grease-
   paint still smudged on the sides of his face.
   He finds an empty seat in the back of the bus. Sees a sad-
   eyed FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL, face puffy from crying, sitting on
   her knees looking back at him. Her mother's facing forward,
   but even from behind you can tell she's angry.
   Joker sees the sad-eyed girl staring straight back at him. He
   doesn't know where to look, feeling self-conscious and small.
   He gets back into "character" smiling like a clown and covers
   his face with his hands-- Starts playing the peek-a-boo game
   with her.
   The girl stares back at him for a moment then giggles--
                        WOMAN ON BUS
                  (turns back to Joker;
                   already annoyed)
             Can you please stop bothering my
             kid?
                       JOKER
             I wasn't bothering her, I was--
                        WOMAN ON BUS
                 (interrupts)
             Just stop.
   AND SUDDENLY JOKER STARTS TO LAUGH. LOUD. He covers his mouth
   trying to hide it-- Shakes his head, laughter pausing for a
   moment, but then it comes on stronger. His eyes are sad. It
   actually looks like the laughter causes him pain.
                                                                                  8.

   People on the bus are staring. The girl looks like she's
   going to cry again.
                           WOMAN ON BUS
                 You think that's funny?
   Joker shakes his head no, but he can't stop laughing. He
   reaches in his pocket and pulls out a small card. Hands it to
   the woman.
   CLOSE ON THE CARD, it reads: "Forgive my laughter. I have a
   condition (more on back)"
   She turns the card over and there is a bunch of information
   in small writing--
   "It's a medical condition causing sudden, frequent, uncontrollable laughter that
   doesn't match how you feel. It can happen in people with a brain injury or certain
   neurological conditions."
   She doesn't read it (but if you freeze frame the movie you
   could). She just shakes her head annoyed and throws the card
   on the ground.
   Joker laughs harder. Tears running down his face.
   Not wanting to attract any more attention to himself, he
   pulls up his red hood, and uses his threadbare scarf to cover
   his mouth, trying to muffle the laughter.
   He looks out at the city passing him by.

5 EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE, STREETS - GOTHAM - EVENING 5

   The bus pulls away, sun almost gone.
   Joker heads slowly down the litter-covered streets. Garbage
   is piled along the sidewalks, the air thick with smog creates
   a haze over everything.
   The streets are crowded with the poor, the elderly and
   disenfranchised. Women with children in busted strollers.
   Homeless people sleeping on subway grates. Stray dogs. His is
   one of the few white faces.
   Joker makes his way into a run-down drug store, behind him
   two drunks fight on the corner, beating the shit out of each
   other. Joker, and nobody else for that matter, pays them any
   attention.
   No one here gives a shit.
                                                              9.

6 INT. LOBBY, APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING 6

   A shabby lobby in a building that was once probably pretty
   nice, but now it's a dump.
   Joker checks his mailbox. He's holding a small white
   (prescription) bag in his hand.
   The mailbox is empty.

7 INT. ELEVATOR, APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 7

   Joker steps onto the wheezing elevator, harsh fluorescent            
   lights, graffiti on the walls. As the door closes, he hears--        
                       SOPHIE (OS)
             Wait!!
   He puts his foot out with some panache to stop the closing
   door-- He's a romantic at heart. Ding.
   And SOPHIE DUMOND (late 20's), tired eyes, hands filled with
   grocery bags, steps onto the elevator with GIGI, her 5-year-
   old daughter.
                        SOPHIE
             Thank you.
                 (realizing)
             Of course it's you,-- everyone else
             in this building is just so fucking
             rude.
   Joker nods "thanks." Holds his breath, hoping he doesn't
   start to laugh.
   Floors dinging as the elevator rises.
   Joker sees GiGi licking the dirty smudged elevator handrail
   behind her mom.
                       SOPHIE
             How's your mom doing?
   He takes a deep breath, he's uncomfortable talking to her,
   holds up the white prescription bag.
                       JOKER
             It's day to day. I'm doing
             everything I can to get her back on
             her feet.
                 (re: pharmacy bag)
             Picked up her medicine. Gonna make
             her some dinner.
                                                           10.

                       SOPHIE
                 (smiles; being polite)
             She's lucky she has you--
   Joker smiles thanks, can't help but glance at GiGi licking
   the rail.
   Sophie finally notices. She wants to grab her but can't with
   her hands full. Tries to kick her away--
                       SOPHIE
             Jesus. Don't do that, GiGi! How
             many times have I told you that?
                 (to Joker)
             This building is so awful, isn't
             it?
   Joker just nods... he doesn't know what to say, but clearly
   wants to continue this conversation with Sophie.
   The doors open. They all step off.
                       SOPHIE
             Okay. Well, tell your mom I said
             hello.
   And Sophie and GiGi walk down the hall-- the opposite way of
   Joker. He just stands there for a beat. Heart beating fast.
                       JOKER
                 (calls out after her)
             Hey Sophie--
   She turns around.
                       JOKER
             I'll tell my mom you said hello.
   She smiles as in "yeah, that's what I said."

8 INT. MOM'S APARTMENT, FRONT DOOR - EVENING 8

   Old apartment, worn carpet. Nothing's new inside but it's
   fairly neat and well-kept.
   Joker closes the door behind him, leans his back against it
   and swoons. Hears a deep purring sound. He looks down and
   sees an OLD ORANGE CAT, rubbing up against his leg.
   Then--
                                                           11.

                       MOM (OS)
                 (shattering the moment,
                  calls out)
             Happy?! Did you check the mail
             before you came up?
                       JOKER
             Yes, Ma. Nothing. No letter.
                       MOM (OS)
             You sure you looked? Sometimes I
             don't know where your head is.
   Joker glances back down and sees the cat is gone.
                       JOKER
             Yes I'm sure. And my head's right
             here. I'm gonna make you some
             dinner, okay?
                                                  QUICK CUTS:
   JOKER TEARS OPEN THE PRESCRIPTION BAG... A FLURRY OF PILL
   BOTTLES TUMBLE OUT ONTO THE COUNTER.
   SEE HIS NAME, "ARTHUR FLECK" ON THE ORANGE PILL BOTTLES, AND
   GLIMPSE THE GENERIC DRUG NAMES, TEMAZEPAM... PERPHENAZINE...
   AHENELZINE... AMITRIPTYLINE... BENZEDRINE... DIAZEPAM...
   MEPROBAMATE...
   TAKES OUT ONE PILL FROM EACH THE TEMAZEPAM AND MEPROBAMATE
   BOTTLES.
   TWO PILLS BEING CRUSHED UP TO POWDER.
   SPRINKLES THE POWDER ON TOP OF A TV DINNER.
   SWALLOWS A HANDFUL OF PILLS FROM THE OTHER BOTTLES.
   LOOKS DOWN AND SMILES AT THE ORANGE CAT LOOKING UP AT HIM
   FROM THE COUNTER.

9 INT. MOM'S BEDROOM, APARTMENT - NIGHT 9

   Joker brings the food to his mother, PENNY (70's), lying in
   her bed. The TV is on, playing the local news.
   Joker sets the food down in front of his mother. He covers
   the pain from his beating the best he can-- His mother
   doesn't seem to notice anyway.
                       MOM
             He must not be getting my letters.
                                                       12.

Joker sits down on a chair next to the bed.

                   JOKER
         He's a busy man.
                   MOM
         Too busy for me? I worked for that
         family for 12 years. He always had
         a smile for me. Least he could do
         is write back.
                   JOKER
         Ma, eat. You need to eat.
                   MOM
         You need to eat. Look how skinny
         you are.
Before Joker can say anything, his mother points to the news on the TV--

                   MOM
         All day long it's more bad news.
         That's all there is.
                   JOKER
         Maybe you shouldn't watch so much
         television.
                   MOM
             (ignoring)
         He's the only hope for Gotham.
         He'll make a great mayor. Everybody
         says so.
                   JOKER
             (playful)
         Everybody who? Who do you talk to?
                   MOM
         Well everybody on the news.
                   JOKER
         Stop it. He's not even gonna run.
         Why would Thomas Wayne want to be
         mayor? He can do more good as a
         businessman.
                   MOM
         Because he cares about this city.
         And everyone in it-- that's why I
         can't believe he hasn't written me
         back.
                                                        13.

                   JOKER
         He will. Now eat some dinner.
He feeds her a bite of the food.

                   JOKER
         How you feeling today?
                   MOM
         I don't know. It always hits me
         worse at night, you notice that?
He shakes his head.

                   JOKER
             (teasing)
         Maybe it's the moon. Maybe you're a
         werewolf?
HE HOWLS SOFTLY like a wolf. She laughs.

                   MOM
         It's not funny.
Joker watches her as he cuts up some more of her food.

                   MOM
         Anyway, I wrote a new letter today.
         A better one. I want you to hand
         deliver it to him.
                      JOKER
         What? Why?
                   MOM
         Cause maybe the mailman is throwing
         them away. We should have tipped
         him at Christmas time.
                   JOKER
         Who tips their mailman?
                   MOM
         Some people do. Rich people do.
Joker sighs, resigned.

                   JOKER
         Okay. I can try his office.
         Tomorrow.
                                                               14.

                         MOM
              Thank you.
                  (she pats the bed)
              Come sit. It's almost on.
    Joker gets into bed with her.
    CLOSE ON TELEVISION, intro to "LIVE WITH MURRAY FRANKLIN!",
    and we HEAR THE ANNOUNCER over clips of comedy bits, stars
    and Murray Franklin himself--
                        ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
              It's Live with Murray Franklin!
              Tonight Murray welcomes, Sandra
              Winger, comedian Skip Byron and the
              piano stylings of Yeldon & Chantel!
              As always, Don Ellis and his Jazz
              Orchestra. And now, without any
              further ado-- Murray Franklin!
    Joker and his mom watch from bed, this is a ritual of theirs.

10 INT. LIVING ROOM, MOM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 10

    Late night. Joker's mom is dead asleep. Joker is alone in the
    living room, which doubles as his bedroom. He can't ever
    sleep. He opens his worn notebook. Flips to a page titled
    "Jokes" and starts writing--
    CLOSE ON WORDS, as he slowly writes: "The worst part about
    having a mental illness is..."
    ANGLE ON JOKER, pausing, thinking it over for a moment. Then
    he laughs to himself when he comes up with something.
    CLOSE ON WORDS, coming faster now, "...that people still
    expect you to behave as if you don't."
                                                       CUT TO:

11 EXT. WAYNE TOWER, STREET - MIDTOWN - MORNING 11

    Joker's looking up at the intimidating steel and glass tower,
    he looks so small, holding his mom's letter in his hand.
    Bustle of professionals coming in and out of the company's
    corporate headquarters, Joker looks out of place.
    He heads inside through the giant glass doors.
                                                               15.

12 INT. RECEPTION, WAYNE ENTERPRISES - 25TH FLOOR - MORNING 12

    Joker steps off an elevator and walks up to the white marble
    reception desk as if he belongs there--
                        JOKER
              Hello. I have a personal letter for
              Mr. Thomas Wayne.
                        RECEPTIONIST
              Okay. You can leave it with me.
                        JOKER
              It's kind of important. I need to
              make sure he gets it himself.
                        RECEPTIONIST
              Oh, in that case, I'll buzz you
              right in.
    Joker goes to enter--
                        RECEPTIONIST
              I'm kidding. Leave it here.
    He laughs along with her, even though she's not laughing.
                        JOKER
              Oh. Right-- well, my mom used to
              work for the Wayne family-- for 12
              years. She was their housekeeper.
    A couple other business people are now waiting behind Joker,
    there for meetings.
                        RECEPTIONIST
              That's great. But you can leave it
              with me or you can leave with the
              letter. Those are your options. Now
              please step aside.
                        JOKER
              Mr. Wayne knows her. Can you maybe
              at least call back to him? Tell him
              that I'm here.
                        RECEPTIONIST
              Thomas Wayne is away on business.
    Joker is getting frustrated.
                        JOKER
              Okay. Well, can I have your name?
              So I know who I left it with.
                                                            16.

    Now Joker sees a GROUP OF MEN walking behind the glass that
    separates the reception area from the back offices. Amongst
    the group, he catches a glimpse of THOMAS WAYNE (60's), deep
    tan, hair dyed so black it's almost blue.
                        JOKER
              Wait. He's right there.
                  (goes up to the glass,
                   shouts)
              Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne.
    He starts banging on the glass... but the group keeps moving.
    Not noticing him.
                        RECEPTIONIST
              Sir. Please stop. Sir!!
    Joker keeps banging on the glass.

13 EXT. WAYNE TOWER, FRONT ENTRANCE - MORNING 13

    The glass doors swing open and Joker is forcibly thrown onto
    the street. TWO LARGE SECURITY GUARDS stand over him.
    He is still holding the letter.
    He makes as if he's going to leave peacefully, then at the
    last minute, TAKES ANOTHER RUN AT THE DOOR--
    The two guards stiff arm him.
                                                       CUT TO:

14 INT. HA-HA'S TALENT BOOKING, LOCKER ROOM - DAY 14

    The cramped locker room of a small talent booking agency.
    This is where Joker works. They "rent out" talent for parties
    and events. Clowns, magicians, male strippers.
    Joker takes off his shirt, grimaces in pain as he moves. His
    body's bruised from the beating he took chasing after his
    sign.
                          RANDALL (OS)
              You okay?
    He turns. RANDALL (mid 50's), a big bear of a know-it-all,
    standing there. He's a party clown as well. He's half-dressed
    in his clown suit.
                                                       17.

                   RANDALL
         I heard about the beat down you
         took. Fucking savages.
                   JOKER
         It was just a bunch of kids. I
         should have left it alone.
Randall opens his locker--

                   RANDALL
         It's crazy out there. And it's only
         getting worse.
                    JOKER
             (nods)
         My mother says that the people
         nowadays lack empathy.
                   RANDALL
         What's empathy?
                   JOKER
         It means like "feeling for other
         people."
                   RANDALL
         Like sympathy?
                   JOKER
         Kind of. But different.
Randall comes over, hands Joker a brown paper bag-- Joker looks inside. It's a GUN, a .38 snub-nose revolver.

Joker looks up at him, confused--

                   RANDALL
         Take it. I got a few. You gotta
         protect yourself out there, buddy.
         Too many wackos.
As Joker stares at it--

                   RANDALL
             (lowers his voice)
         It's a .38 snub-nose. Gets the job
         done if you ever need to use it.
         Usually pulling it out is enough.
                   JOKER                                      
         I, I don't have the money for this,                  
         Randall.
                                                               18.

                        RANDALL
              Don't sweat it. You can pay me some
              other time. You're my boy.
    That lands with Joker, he smiles to himself.
                        RANDALL
                  (as he walks away)
              But you didn't get it from me,
              okay?
    Joker nods. Puts the brown paper bag in his locker. Slowly         
    starts to get dressed-- his eyes darting toward the bag as he      
    does.
    Another clown, GARY (30's), a dwarf, pops his head into the
    locker room.
                        GARY
              Arthur,-- Hoyt wants to see you in
              his office.
                          JOKER
              What for?
                          GARY
              No clue.

15 INT. FRONT OFFICE, HA-HA'S TALENT BOOKING - DAY 15

    Joker still half-dressed, walks into the cramped office.
    His boss, HOYT VAUGHN (60's) sits behind a metal desk. The
    office is a complete mess, newspapers and files litter the
    desk. A giant ashtray filled with cigarette butts. A calendar
    of booking hangs on the wall. A scribbled, jumbled mess.
                        JOKER
              Hey Hoyt. Gary said you wanted to
              see me?
                        HOYT
                  (without even looking up)
              How's the comedy career? Are you a
              famous stand-up yet?
                        JOKER
              Not quite. Haven't even performed
              yet. Just been working my material.
              This business is all about fine-
              tuning.
    Now Hoyt looks up. Takes a drag from his cigarette.
                                                        19.

                      HOYT
         Right.
Joker goes to sit down--

                   HOYT
         Don't sit. This will be quick.
Joker stops in his tracks.

                    HOYT
         Look, I like you, Arthur. A lot of
         the guys here, they think you're a
         freak. But I like you. I don't even
         know why I like you. I mean, you
         don't say much.
             (beat)
         It's probably that stupid laugh. It
         gets me every time. Kills me.
Unsure how to respond, Joker just nods.

                   HOYT
         But I got another complaint. And
         it's starting to piss me off.
Joker takes a deep breath, maybe picks at his eyebrow.

                   HOYT
         Kenny's Music. Sunday. The guy said
         you disappeared. Never even
         returned his sign.
                   JOKER
         No. I got jumped. I told you about
         that.
                   HOYT
         For a sign? Bullshit. It makes no
         sense, just give him his sign back.
         He's going out of business for
         god's--
BANG! Out of nowhere, Joker slams his head into the wall. Head-butting it hard.

                      HOYT
                (taken aback)
         Hey!
BANG! BANG! He does it two more times. Breaking the plaster on the wall--

                                                               20.

                        HOYT
              What the fuck, Arthur?!
                        JOKER
                  (voice tightens)
              I don't have his sign.                                   
    And Joker just stares at Hoyt, some blood forming on his
    forehead--                                                         
                                                         CUT TO:       

16 EXT. BACK ALLEY, OUTSIDE HA-HA'S - AMUSEMENT MILE - DAY 16

    WE'RE AT THE FAR END OF AN ALLEY, about halfway down, catch a      
    glimpse of Joker still half-dressed on the other side of a         
    dumpster. From this vantage, all we can see is him furiously       
    KICKING and STOMPING on something... or somebody.                  
    We don't hear anything. And we can't make out what it is that      
    he's so violently beating down.                                    
    It could be a cat... a cardboard box... a homeless person...       
    We don't know.                                                     
    Joker just continues unleashing his rage--                         

17 INT. CITY BUS (MOVING) - DUSK 17

    Joker at the end of his work day, sitting in his spot toward
    the back of the bus.
    Across the aisle from him, he's innocently watching a young
    couple, playfully teasing each other.

18 EXT. GOTHAM, LOWER EAST SIDE - EVENING 18

    Joker heading back home down the litter-covered streets like
    he does every night. Garbage still piled along the sidewalks,
    air still thick with smog.
    He's carrying the paper bag that Randall gave him.

19 INT. LOBBY, APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING 19

    Joker checks his mailbox. Empty.
                                                            21.

20 INT. ELEVATOR, APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 20

    Joker is on the elevator, as the door closes, he sticks his
    foot out to stop it.
    The door limps back open. Ding.
    He looks to see if anybody, if Sophie, is coming. He waits.
    Hoping.
    The door starts to close on him again-- Right before it does,     
    he stops it with his foot again. Ding.

21 INT. MOM'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT 21

    JOKER'S GIVING HIS MOM A BATH, being careful with her as he
    shampoos her hair.
                        MOM
              --so what did he say when you gave
              him the letter?
                        JOKER
              They wouldn't let me see him.
                  (lying)
              But they promised me it would get
              to him.
                        MOM
              It's good they promised. He only
              works with the best. We should hear
              something soon.
    He fills an empty plastic container with some bath water.
                         JOKER
              Look up.
    She tilts her head back and he rinses her hair with the water
    from the container...
                        JOKER
              Why are these letters so important
              to you, Ma? What do you think he's
              gonna do?
                        MOM
              He's gonna help us.
                        JOKER
              Help us how?
                                                            22.

                        MOM
              Get us out of here, take me away
              from this place and these-- these
              awful people.
                        JOKER
              You worked for him over 30 years
              ago. What makes you think he would
              help you?
    She looks at him with conviction.
                        MOM
              Because Thomas Wayne is a good man.
              If he knew how I was living, if he
              saw this place, it would make him
              sick. I can't explain it to you any
              better than that.
    Joker nods. Annoyed, but not worth the argument. He stands up
    to get her a towel.
                        JOKER
              I don't want you worrying about
              money. Everyone's been telling me
              they think my stand-up is ready for
              the big clubs. It's just a matter
              of time before I get a break.
    She steps into the towel. He's helping dry her off.
                        MOM
              Happy, what makes you think you
              could do that?
                        JOKER
              What do you mean?
                        MOM
              I mean, don't you have to be funny
              to be a comedian?
    Beat.

22 INT. MOM'S BEDROOM, APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT 22

    Joker's mom is out cold in her bedroom, a half-eaten plate of
    food is next to her on the bed.
                                                            23.

23 INT. LIVING ROOM, MOM'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 23

    Joker sits on the couch. The TV is on, but the sound is off.
    He holds the .38 SNUB-NOSE REVOLVER Randall gave him in his
    hand. He's never held a gun before, looks uncomfortable with
    it, the weight of it in his hand...
    He points it at the TV, hand trembling a bit... Points it at       
    the cat... Points it at his head.
    Looks closely at the grip. The barrel. The cylinder. Now he
    casually pulls the trigger--
    BLAMMMMMMM!
    He jumps up off the couch. What the fuck!? He looks around in
    a panic. His hands shaking.
    He shot a hole in the wall.
                        MOM (OS)
                  (awoken by the shot)
              HAPPY!? What was that?
                        JOKER
              What?!
    He quickly turns up the TV volume. REALLY LOUD. Shoves the
    still smoking gun under the couch cushions.
                        MOM (OS)
              THAT NOISE! DID YOU HEAR THAT
              NOISE?
    He's inspecting the hole in the wall. Shouts back over the TV
    noise--
                        JOKER
              I'M WATCHING AN OLD WAR MOVIE.
                        MOM (OS)
              TURN IT DOWN!
    He heads for his mother's bedroom.

24 INT. MOM'S BEDROOM, DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS 24

    Joker looks in on his mom in her dark bedroom, can make out
    the outline of her body sitting up.
                        MOM
              It's so loud.
                                                               24.

                        JOKER
              I know. The Americans are really
              giving it to the Japs.
    He walks over to her in the darkness. Kisses her on the
    forehead.
                        JOKER
                  (softly)
              I'm sorry. I'll turn it down.

25 INT. KITCHEN, MOM'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT 25

    Joker is writing in his journal. He speaks softly to himself
    as he writes...
                         JOKER
              Why didn't Randall tell me the gun
              was loaded? He's my friend. With my
              luck, I could have killed someone.
                  (beat)
              I could have killed myself.
    CLOSE ON THE LAST LINE, he crosses out "could"...
    Writes... "should".
                        JOKER
                  (still to himself)
              I should have killed myself.
    CLOSE ON JOKER as he crosses out something again...
                        JOKER
                  (louder to himself)
              I should kill myself.
    Beat.

26 EXT. STREET, LOWER EAST SIDE - MORNING 26

    HANDHELD POV, see the run-down building where Joker lives
    from across the street.
    REVEAL, Joker is watching his own building on the far side of
    a parked truck. Red hood pulled up, covering his head. He
    waits. Watches.
    Now we see Sophie exiting the building with her daughter
    GiGi. Sophie's dressed more conservatively than when we
    previously met her.
                                                               25.

    Joker starts following them.

27 EXT. PUBLIC SCHOOL - MORNING 27

    Sophie drops GiGi off at school. Joker's still watching.
    Following.

28 EXT. ELEVATED SUBWAY PLATFORM - MORNING 28

    Sophie waits on the platform. Lights a cigarette.
    We see Joker, hidden behind a steel support beam-- watching
    her from a distance.

29 INT. SUBWAY (MOVING) - MORNING 29

    Joker stands at the window between two subway cars. Just
    watching Sophie as she reads a book in the next car.
    The train comes to a stop and she exits. Joker exits as well.

30 EXT. STREET, UPPER EAST SIDE - MORNING 30

    Nicer part of Gotham. Joker follows Sophie from a distance,
    watches as she walks into Gotham First National Bank.
    Sees her say hello to the guard. This is where she works.
    Joker just watches and waits.

31 INT. GOTHAM FIRST NATIONAL - LATER 31

    A large, mid-level bank. Sophie is one of THREE BANK TELLERS
    working behind the plexiglass windows.
    Joker pulls the hood back off his head, takes a deep breath
    before he walks up to her window. She is looking down,
    counting her drawer.
    Takes another deep breath. Then--
                        JOKER
              Hello. I'd like to open an account.
    She looks up.
                        SOPHIE
                  (surprised)
              Hey, what are you doing up here?
                                                       26.

                   JOKER
         Oh, hi. That's weird.
             (pausing to see if he's
              gonna laugh; he's good)
         I didn't know you worked at a bank.
                   SOPHIE
         Pretty glamorous, right?
Not getting the sarcasm, Joker nods. Looks around.

                   JOKER
         Very glamorous. Look at this place.
She laughs.

He stands there awkwardly for a moment looking around to see what she's laughing about.

Realizes she thought he was making a joke.

Beat.

                   JOKER
         I'm a comedian. I do stand-up
         comedy.
                   SOPHIE
         Really? I had no idea.
                   JOKER
         Yeah. You know, I'm always making
         funny observations. Always on the
         look out for my next bit-- so it
         makes sense.
                   SOPHIE
         Right. Anyway, is there something I
         could help you with?
Beat.

                   JOKER
         I said hi to my mom.
                      SOPHIE
         Excuse me?
                   JOKER
         Last week. You said to say hi to my
         mom. I did. Made her day.
They are interrupted by the BRANCH MANAGER (50's), white, heavy-set, who has come up behind Sophie--

                                                            27.

                        BRANCH MANAGER
              Everything okay here?
    He puts his heavy hand on Sophie's shoulder. She practically
    shudders from his touch.
                        SOPHIE
              Everything is fine Mr. Slotnick.
    Now he leans down and whispers something in her ear-- Joker
    just watches through the glass.
                        SOPHIE
                  (shakes her head; to her
                   manager)
              No. He's not. He's interested in
              opening an account.
                        BRANCH MANAGER
                  (to Joker)
              Great. You just need to fill out a
              form. They are back there-- against
              the wall.
    As the manager talks, Sophie makes wide eyes at Joker, like
    "I almost got in trouble."
                         JOKER
                  (covering; trying to act
                   cool)
              Okay. Thank you, sir. And thank you
              as well, Miss.
    Joker walks back to the wall by the forms.
    He fumbles around for a minute, clearly not there to open an
    account. He begins filling out a form. Then--
                        JOKER
                  (shouts out, to no one in
                   particular)
              YOU KNOW WHAT?! I FORGOT MY ID!
              I'LL BE BACK. THANK YOU.
    He walks out of the bank. Head in the clouds.

32 INT. GOTHAM COMEDY CLUB, CHINATOWN - NIGHT 32

    Joker sitting in the middle of a dark, crowded comedy club.     
    People on dates. Groups of friends. All here to watch the
    stand-up. He sits at a small table by himself, watching the
    act on stage.
                                                             28.

    The comic on stage is killing it. The whole room is laughing
    and applauding. Everyone except Joker.
    He's watching. Studying. Diligently jotting down notes in his
    notebook.

33 EXT. GOTHAM COMEDY CLUB, STREET - CHINATOWN - NIGHT 33

    People are piling out of the club, onto the narrow street,         
    jumble of lit-up signs, most glowing yellow or red. Joker          
    walks out alone, carrying his notebook. He sees a FLYER taped      
    to the entrance of the club.                                       
    CLOSE ON THE FLYER, "Open mic night. Thursdays. 10pm."
    He rips the flyer off the wall.

34 INT. HA-HA'S TALENT BOOKING, LOCKER ROOM - DAY 34

    Joker is working on his "Mr. Jingles" clown look, using the
    small mirror in his locker. Behind him a couple of other
    clowns are eating their lunch at a small table, not paying
    Joker any attention.
    Joker pauses half-finished, and stares at himself for a beat.
    He starts to examine the two small scars on the corners of
    his mouth, we really notice how they form a smile. Joker
    hooks the corners of his mouth down with his index fingers,
    turning his smile into a frown--
    He lets go and his smile returns.
    Does it again, up and down, up and down, his face a living
    comedy/tragedy mask.
    And then he pulls his fingers wider, stretching his smile
    into a grotesque parody, pulling his mouth so wide tears come
    to his eyes--
    AND WE HEAR JOKER SINGING "If You're Happy and You Know It"
    at his next gig.
                        JOKER (PRE-LAP)
                  (singing)
              --if you're happy and you know it
              and you really want to show it, if
              you're happy and you know it clap
              your hands.
                                                            29.

35 INT. GOTHAM GENERAL - CHILDREN'S WARD - EVENING 35

    Joker is performing for a ward full of sick children, wearing
    an oversized white lab coat over his "Mr. Jingles" clown
    costume. A few nurses and doctors watch as well.
    His white clown face, mouth outlined in black and filled in
    with red, his green wig frizzy and worn out. Joker plays a
    UKULELE along with the song.
                        JOKER
              If you're happy and you know it,
              stomp your feet.
    Joker and the kids stomp and sing along.
                         JOKER
              If you're happy and you know it,
              stomp your feet.
                  (stomp, stomp)
              If you're happy and you know it and
              you really want to show it, if
              you're happy and you know it stomp
              your feet.
    As the song winds down, the KIDS and NURSES clap.
    Joker takes an exaggerated and ridiculous bow--
    And as he does, his .38 SNUB-NOSE REVOLVER slips out of his
    pants and slides across the floor.
    Everyone stops. Looks at the gun on the floor.

36 INT. LOBBY, GOTHAM GENERAL - LATER 36

    Joker is on a payphone in the lobby of the hospital. He's in
    his street clothes, wig in his hand, clown-face still painted
    on.
                        JOKER
                  (into phone)
              Hoyt, let me explain.
                        HOYT (OVER PHONE)
              Oh, this'll be good. Please tell me
              why you brought a gun into a sick
              kid's ward?
                        JOKER
                  (into phone)
              It was, it was a prop gun. It's
              part of my act now.
                                                        30.

                   HOYT (OVER PHONE)
         Bullshit. Jingles would never carry
         a fucking gun. Besides, Randall
         told me you tried to buy a .38 off
         him last week.
Joker's taken aback that Randall would do that to him.

                   JOKER
             (into phone)
         Randall told you that?
                   HOYT (OVER PHONE)
         He was with me when the call came
         in. You're a fuck up, Arthur. And a
         liar. You're fired.
                   JOKER
             (into phone)
         Hoyt--
                    HOYT (OVER PHONE)
         Say it, Arthur.
             (beat)
         Let me hear you say it.
                   JOKER
             (into phone)
         Say what?
                   HOYT (OVER PHONE)
         I'm a fuck up and I'm fired.
Joker picks at his eyebrow.

                   JOKER
             (into phone; low)
         --I'm a fuck up and I'm fired.

                   HOYT (OVER PHONE)
         Yes. You are.
Click. He hears Hoyt hang up.

Beat.

                                                               31.

37 INT. SUBWAY (MOVING) - NIGHT 37

    JOKER SITS ON THE SUBWAY CONTEMPLATING WHAT JUST WENT DOWN,
    face still painted, his bag on the seat next to him, along
    with his wig.
    There's only one other person on the subway car, a YOUNG
    WOMAN (30's) sitting at the far end-- reading a book.
    The train comes to a stop and THREE WALL STREET GUYS enter.
    They are being loud and obnoxious, clearly drunk. One of them
    is eating some french fries out of a greasy McDonald's bag.
    He flops down on the bench across from the girl and checks
    her out. The other two guys start getting into it with each
    other--
                        WALL STREET #1
              --I'm telling you, she wanted my
              number. We should have just stayed.
    The train starts moving again...
                        WALL STREET #2
              You're dreaming, man. She wasn't
              interested-- at all.
                        WALL STREET #1
              Are you nuts? Did you see how close
              we were dancing!? She was in love,
              bro.
    He starts dancing a bit with himself, mimicking what he
    remembers. Wall Street #2 takes a swig from the brown bag he
    is carrying.
                        WALL STREET #2
              She couldn't wait to get away from
              you.
    Joker is watching them closely, impressed by their confidence
    and easy-going camaraderie.
                         WALL STREET #1
                   (to the third guy)
              Ryan, am I crazy? Tell him what you
              saw.
    But the third Wall Street guy isn't paying his friends any
    attention. He has his eyes set on the young woman sitting
    across from him, reading her book.
                        WALL STREET #3
                  (to the girl)
              Hey. You want some french fries?
                                                       32.

He holds out his McDonald's bag and shakes it to get her attention. The other two share a look. Joker watches from his seat.

                   WALL STREET #3
         Hello? I'm talking to you. You want
         some fries?
She looks up and shakes her head, polite smile.

                   YOUNG WOMAN
         No thank you.
The other two guys crack up at this apparent blow-off. The third Wall Street guy shakes his head, embarrassed, and starts softly flinging fries at the young woman.

                   WALL STREET #3
         You sure? They're really good.
She just buries her face deeper in her book--

                   WALL STREET #2
         Don't ignore him. He's being nice
         to you.
One of the french fries lands in her hair. She looks down toward Joker, looking to see if he's going to do something or say something--

Joker just sits there nervous. Not sure what to do, or even if he wants to do anything at all.

AND HE JUST BURSTS OUT LAUGHING. He covers his mouth with his hand as they continue to harass the woman.

They all look over-- What the fuck is this clown laughing at?

                   WALL STREET #1
         Something funny, asshole?
With their attention diverted, the young woman rushes out through the door between subway cars, glancing back at Joker before she goes--

                   WALL STREET #3
             (shouts after her)
         BITCH!
Joker laughs even harder through his hand. The Wall Street guys turn to him sitting by himself at the end of the car--

                                                         33.

Joker sees them staring. Looks down at the ground, hand still covering his mouth, face turning red. Subway swaying, lights flickering on and off.

Beat.

One of the guys heads down the car toward Joker, starts singing "Send in the Clowns" as he approaches--

                   WALL STREET #1
             (singing)
         Isn't it rich?
         Are we a pair?
         Me here, at last on the ground                         
         You in mid-air
         Send in the clowns.                                    
The others crack up and follow after him. The guy plops down next to Joker, puts his arm around his shoulder as he sings--

                   JOKER
             (shakes his head, stifling
              the laughter)
         Please. Don't.
                   WALL STREET #1
             (continues singing to him)
         Isn't it bliss?
         Don't you approve?
         One who keeps tearing around,
         One who can't move.
Joker starts to get up-- The lead guy pulls him back down.

                   WALL STREET #1
         Where are the clowns?
         There ought to be clowns.
As he finishes the song, Joker's laughing fit is coming to an end. One of the other guys sits down on the other side of him. He's now sandwiched in between them--

                   WALL STREET #2
         So tell us, buddy. What's so
         fucking funny?
                   JOKER
         Nothing. I have a condition--
Joker reaches into his bag to get one of his "Forgive my laughter" cards, the third guy sees him reaching and tries to grab the bag from him---

Joker pulls on it--

                                                       34.

                   JOKER
         No. It's just my stuff. I don't
         have anything.
The guy rips the bag from his hand--

                   WALL STREET #3
         I'll tell you what you have,
         asshole.
Joker gets up from between them to go grab his bag back. The two guys are cracking up.

                   WALL STREET #3
         You want it back? Here--
Joker reaches out to grab the bag--

And the guy tosses it over his head to one of his friends. Keeping it away from Joker.

Three guys in suits tossing a bag around, playing 'monkey in the middle' with a clown. THE LIGHTS ON THE TRAIN SEEM TO GLOW BRIGHTER AND WE HEAR the drum roll opening to BOBBY SHORT singing "Send in the Clowns" Live at the Caf  Carlyle.

Joker keeps trying to catch his bag until suddenly--

WHAP! Out of nowhere one of the guys punches him hard in the face.

Joker goes down as if in slow motion. Blood coming from his nose. He tries to get up, but his feet slip from under him and he falls back down--

                   WALL STREET #1
         Stay down you freak.
And the third Wall Street guy starts kicking him--

The others join in. Surrounding Joker on the ground, kicking him deliberately, sadistically, and the music swells--

BLAM!

SUDDENLY THE LIGHTS GO BACK DIM, and one of the guys stops kicking and falls back dead. Blood splattering on the subway wall behind him--

And we HEAR Bobby Short sing out, picking up from where the Wall Street Guy left off--

                                                            35.

                        BOBBY SHORT (SINGING)                          
              Just when I'd stopped opening doors                      
              Finally knowin' the one that I                           
              wanted was yours                                         
    BLAM! BLAM! Wall Street #2 goes down--
    Revealing Joker on the ground, opening his eyes to see what
    he did, smoking gun in his hand--
                        BOBBY SHORT (SINGING)                          
              Making my entrance again with my                         
              usual flair                                              
              Sure of my lines                                         
              No one is there                                          
    The third guy takes off running for the doors that separate        
    the cars.                                                          
    Joker starts after him, but then stops... turns back to grab
    his bag and his wig, his hands shaking from the adrenaline.
    The train is coming to a stop.
                        BOBBY SHORT (SINGING)                          
              Don't you love farce?                                    
              My fault I fear...                                       
    Joker picks up his bag between the two dead bodies, blood          
    everywhere...
    The subway doors wheeze open and Joker steps halfway off the
    train, waiting to see if the third Wall Street guy gets off
    in the car ahead of him. Joker sees him run off--

38 EXT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS 38

    The platform is empty, the Wall Street guy is running toward
    the stairs--
    Joker follows--
    Behind them, the train pulls away--
                        BOBBY SHORT (SINGING)                          
              I thought that you'd want what I                         
              want.                                                    
              Sorry, my dear.                                          
    The guy makes his way to the stairs, unaware that Joker is
    behind him--
    BLAM!
                                                               36.

    The third guy falls, tumbling down the stairs. Joker walks
    over to the body and empties the chamber-- BLAM! BLAM!             
                        BOBBY SHORT (SINGING)                          
              But where are the clowns?                                
              Quick, send in the clowns                                
              Don't bother they're here.                               
    And as "Send in the Clowns" ends, Joker fires the last shot--      
    BLAM! He's got nothing left.                                       

39 EXT. STREET, ROBINSON SQUARE PARK - NIGHT 39

    Joker hauls ass out of the subway and makes a mad dash across      
    a busy street, horns honking--                                     
    Running as fast as he can past piles of garbage, he takes a        
    sharp turn high-tailing into a small, run-down needle park,        
    disappearing into the darkness.                                    

40 INT. PUBLIC BATHROOM, ROBINSON SQUARE PARK - NIGHT 40

    Joker runs into the bathroom, locks the door behind him and        
    SUDDENLY EVERYTHING HITS HIM ALL AT ONCE--                         
    He throws up into the dirty toilet, puking his guts out--          
    He finishes, wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. And        
    pulls the gun out of his waist, looking around for someplace       
    to throw it out. Under the sink he sees a rusted, metal grate      
    hanging off the wall covering some pipes.                          
    Before he bends down, Joker catches his reflection in the          
    smudged mirror. Sees himself holding the gun in his hand--         
    Beat.                                                              
    He raises the gun to his head and pulls the trigger--              
    Click.                                                             
    It's empty.                                                        
    He gets down on his knees, sweat dripping off his face, pulls      
    the grate away from the wall. And tosses the gun away inside.      
    Moves the grate back in place.                                     
    Joker stands back up and turns on the faucets. Rinses out his      
    mouth.                                                             
    Looks at his smudged reflection as he starts washing the           
    clown make-up off his sweaty face--                                
                                                            37.

                        JOKER
              Hi. Do you like to laugh?
    Water dripping, white grease paint running off his face--         
                        JOKER
              Remember how I told you that I'm a
              stand-up comedian?
                  (again)
              Hi. How are you?
    Beat.

41 INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, LOBBY - LATER 41

    Joker enters his building with great urgency. No time for the     
    elevator, he takes the stairs. Two at a time.
    He races up the stairwell.

42 INT. HALLWAY, APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 42

    When he gets to his floor, instead of making a left toward
    his apartment-- He makes a right, toward Sophie's. He stops
    at her door. Out of breath.
    Knocks.
    He hears footsteps. Quickly pulls the folded-up flyer out of
    his pocket.
    The peephole in the door goes dark and then light again. He
    hears locks unlocking. Sophie opens the door halfway--            
    Joker looks down at his feet--                                    
                        JOKER
              Hi. Do you like to laugh?                               
                        SOPHIE                                        
              What?                                                   
                        JOKER                                         
                  (continuing without taking                          
                   a breath)                                          
              Remember the other day when I told                      
              you about my stand-up comedy. Well,
              I'm doing a set next Thursday and
              I'm inviting a bunch of my friends
              and I was wondering if maybe you
              wanted to come and check it out.
                                                       38.

He reaches out to give Sophie the flyer, she opens the door wider-- He notices her face, sees her eyes are red.

                   JOKER
         Were you crying? Why are you
         crying?
Beat.

                   SOPHIE
         I had a bad day.
                   JOKER
         I'm sorry. I, I didn't--
                   SOPHIE
         It's okay. How would you know.
                   JOKER
         What happened?
                   SOPHIE
         I got fired. From the bank.
Joker takes a deep breath and smiles without realizing it, hoping he doesn't start to laugh.

                     JOKER
         What for?
                   SOPHIE
         Because,-- I don't know. It doesn't
         fucking matter. I don't know what
         I'm gonna do.
And she starts crying again. Joker doesn't move. Just stands in the doorway awkward.

                   JOKER
             (finally)
         Okay. Well, all the info is right
         there on the flyer.
He starts to walk away, then turns back to her--

                   JOKER
         You know they say laughter is the
         best medicine.
Sophie wipes her eyes and manages a smile.

                   SOPHIE
         Is that what they say?
                                                               39.

    Joker just nods yes and walks back toward his mother's
    apartment.

43 INT. DEPT. OF HEALTH, OFFICE - MORNING 43

    JOKER SITS ACROSS from the same Social Worker from the
    opening scene. Same depressing office.
    She stares at him for a beat, clearly annoyed.
                        SOCIAL WORKER
              We spoke about this last time,
              Arthur. You're supposed to bring
              your journal with you.
                        JOKER
              Well I didn't think you were going
              to read it.
                        SOCIAL WORKER
              You said it didn't bother you.
                        JOKER
              I lied. Everything bothers me.
                        SOCIAL WORKER
              What about it bothered you?
                        JOKER
              It's personal. It's my private
              thoughts. Plus it contains original
              comedy material that I don't feel
              comfortable handing over to you.
    She looks at him and shakes her head. Not in the mood to deal
    with this.
                        SOCIAL WORKER
              Arthur, I have some bad news for
              you.
    He looks up, intrigued.
                        SOCIAL WORKER
              They've cut our funding. We're
              closing down our offices next week.
    He looks around, just noticing some MOVING BOXES stacked
    against the wall.
                        JOKER
              So where will we be meeting?
                                                             40.

                        SOCIAL WORKER
              We won't be. The city's cut funding
              across the board. Social services
              is part of that.
    Joker nods, not hating the idea.
                        JOKER
              Okay.
                        SOCIAL WORKER
              They don't give a shit about people
              like you, Arthur. You don't have a
              voice and they don't really care
              what happens to you or to us for
              that matter.
    He sits there for a moment. And then it dawns on him--
                        JOKER
              How am I gonna get my medication?
    Beat.

44 INT. MOM'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - MORNING 44

    CLOSE ON A COUPLE OF PILLS, as they get crushed up.
    CLOSE ON THE RESIDUE, as it's sprinkled on top of a bowl of
    oatmeal.
                        MOM (OS)
              Happy! Come in here. Thomas Wayne
              is on TV.
    Joker takes a couple of pills for himself. Looks inside. Not
    many left. He looks over at the orange cat sitting on the
    counter, purring loudly, watching him.
                        MOM (OS)
              Quick! Come.

45 INT. MOM'S BEDROOM, APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 45

    Joker walks in carrying her breakfast. She waves him over to
    her bed.
                        MOM
              They're interviewing him about
              those horrible murders on the
              subway last week.
                                                       41.

                   JOKER
         Why are they talking to him?
His mother shushes him. Joker sits on the end of the bed next to her. It's one of those "Good Morning, Gotham" shows.

                   THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV)
         --as you know, Jerry, all three of
         them worked at Wayne Investments,
         and they were the best of the best.
         Solid young men.
A small smirk registers on Joker's face when photos of the THREE WALL STREET GUYS come up on the screen.

                   THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV)
         And while I didn't know them
         personally, like all Wayne
         employees, past and present, they
         were family.
Joker's mom perks up at that--

                   MOM
         You hear that! I told you. We're
         family.
ANGLE ON TELEVISION, footage of GRAFFITI around the city. "KILL THE RICH" spray painted on a storefront. "F CK WALL STREET" written on a subway wall. "RESIST" scrawled across a billboard.

                   "GOOD MORNING" HOST (ON TV)
         There now seems to be a groundswell
         of anti-rich sentiment in the city.
         It's almost as if our less
         fortunate residents have taken the
         side of the killer.
                   THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV)
         Yes and it's a shame. It's one of
         the reasons I'm considering a run
         for mayor. Gotham has lost its way.
                   "GOOD MORNING" HOST (ON TV)
         Are you announcing your candidacy?
                   THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV)
             (smiles)
         No comment.
We hear his mother gasp, excited.

                                                               42.

                        "GOOD MORNING" HOST (ON TV)
              What about the eyewitness report of
              the suspect being a man in clown
              make-up or a clown mask-- Care to
              comment on that?
    Joker leans in, intrigued. The camera zooms in closer to
    Thomas Wayne on the screen...
                        THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV)
              It makes total sense to me. What
              kind of coward would do something
              that cold-blooded? Someone who
              hides behind a mask. Someone who's
              envious of those more fortunate
              than themselves, yet too scared to
              show their own face.
                  (to camera)
              And until that jealousy ends, those
              of us who've made a good life for
              ourselves will always look at those
              who haven't as nothing but clowns.

46 INT. COMEDY CLUB, BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - NIGHT 46

    JOKER'S POV, slowly walking down the hall -- as if in slow
    motion -- toward a curtain at the end, spotlight bleeding
    through, other wannabe comics looking at him as he passes--
    CLOSE ON JOKER, eyeing the others, sweat beading on his
    forehead--
    He gets to the curtain, the light, pulls his worn joke-
    notebook out of his back pocket. Glancing into the room he
    sees it's a pretty good crowd. Sees Sophie taking a seat in
    the back.
    Wheeling back into the dark hallway, he catches his breath in
    the shadows--
    And starts BANGING HIS HEAD BACK against the wall--
    He hears the EMCEE from the stage.
                        EMCEE (OS)
              This next comic describes himself
              as a lifelong Gotham resident who
              from a young age was always told
              that "his purpose in life was to
              bring joy and laughter into this
              cold, dark world." Ummm. Okay.
                                                               43.

    He hears the crowd laugh.
                        EMCEE (OS)
              Please help me welcome Arthur
              Fleck!
    There is a smattering of applause.
                                                       CUT TO:
    JOKER STEPPING ON STAGE, out under the spotlight, lifts the
    microphone in front of his mouth, the light so bright he
    can't see faces in the dark audience, his hand trembling
    holding onto his worn notebook--
    He takes a deep breath, looks out at the dark crowd, and
    opens his mouth.
    And starts to laugh. His eyes go wide. God no, not now. A
    terrified look comes to his face under the laughter. He just
    keeps laughing. The crowd is just staring back at him.
    Finally he composes himself--
                         JOKER
                  (trying to stop himself
                   from laughing)
              -- good evening, hello.
                  (deep breath; trying to
                   stop laughing)
              Good to be here.
                  (keeps cracking up)
              I, I hated school as a kid. But my
              mother would always say,--
                  (bad imitation of his mom,
                   still laughing)
              "You should enjoy it. One day
              you'll have to work for a living."
                  (laughs)
              "No I won't, Ma. I'm gonna be a
              comedian!"
    Dead silence. Except for Joker, who's still cracking up.
                                                       CUT TO:

47 EXT. COMEDY CLUB, CHINATOWN STREET - NIGHT 47

    Joker and Sophie walking out of the club after the show, the
    audience trickles out around them. Nobody looking in Joker's
    direction, nobody says anything to him, maybe one or two even
    cracking up at him behind his back. Garbage bags crowding the      
    narrow street, lit up by the bright signs.                         
                                                          44.

Joker and Sophie walk a ways without saying a word. Awkward silence.

Then--

                   JOKER
         So, did you laugh? Really couldn't
         see much from up there.
Sophie pauses, doesn't know what to say. She lights up a cigarette.

                   SOPHIE
             (trying to be nice)
         Of course. Yeah. You couldn't hear
         anything?
                   JOKER
         All I heard was my heart pounding.
                    SOPHIE
         It was good. I really needed to get
         out of my apartment so, thanks.
             (beat)
         What happened to the rest of your
         friends?
                   JOKER
         What friends?
                   SOPHIE
         Didn't you say some of your friends
         were coming?
                   JOKER
             (he forgot; recovers)
         Yeah, I decided not to invite them.
         As a performer sometimes you want
         to see how a "real" crowd reacts.
         People who don't already love me,
         or, or have a notion of who I am,
         you know?
                   SOPHIE
             (nodding)
         Yeah. I get that.
Joker smiles at the connection. They walk past a newsstand-- a wall of Chinese language newspapers mixed with local papers and tabloids, screaming headlines about the three Wall Street Guys gunned down on the train.

Joker stops and stares at the headlines--

                                                          45.

CLOSE ON HEADLINES, "Subway Vigilante"... "Yuppie Slaughter" "Killer Clown On The Loose?"...

                   SOPHIE (OS)
             (re: the headlines)
         You believe that shit?
                   JOKER
         Yeah,-- I don't know how something
         like that happens.
                   SOPHIE
         Please. I'll bet you five bucks
         those rich assholes deserved it.
He turns to her.

                      JOKER
         You think?
                   SOPHIE
         Look at their faces. Those smug
         smiles. I've seen that look. Fuck
         them.
Sophie flicks her cigarette away and starts walking.

                   SOPHIE
         The guy who did it is a hero. Three
         less pricks in Gotham City. Woo-
         hoo! Only a million more to go.
Joker watches her walk for a beat.

                   JOKER
             (calls out to her)
         Hey. You want to get some coffee?
Sophie turns around and smiles. She looks great, even in front of the mounds of garbage bags that line the sidewalk.

AN AMBULANCE SCREAMS BY, SIRENS BLARING as Sophie says something that Joker doesn't hear. She keeps walking.

Joker chases after her and trips over a TIN GARBAGE CAN LID--

CLANG. CLANG. He falls down flat on his face.

Sophie turns and bursts out laughing. She can't help but laugh. It's the first time she's laughed all night.

                                                            46.

48 INT. SZECHUAN ACE RESTAURANT, TABLE - NIGHT 48

    Table covered with plates of half-eaten Chinese food.           
    Joker and Sophie sitting across from each other, middle of      
    conversation. Crowded room, brightly lit, looks more like a     
    casino. Almost everybody eating there is Chinese. It's loud.    
                        SOPHIE
              --I'm telling you, it's across the
              board. Wall Street, the banks,
              politicians. They've been making a
              killing for years. Fuck them.
    Joker takes a moment to think about what she said.
                        JOKER
              I don't know.
                        SOPHIE
              What don't you know?
                        JOKER
              Not all of them are awful. Take
              someone like Thomas Wayne for
              example. He's a hero.
                        SOPHIE
              Oh c'mon, he's the worst!
    Joker is taken aback--
                        JOKER
              Sophie, he's the only one who can
              save this city.
                        SOPHIE
              You can't be serious!? He's a
              complete narcissist. Brags about
              his money. Meanwhile, the rest of
              us can barely make rent. Or feed
              our kids.
    Joker nods. Thinking about it.
    Then--
                        JOKER
              What happened?
                           SOPHIE
              With what?
                                                       47.

                   JOKER
         With your job. At the bank?
                   SOPHIE
             (suddenly uncomfortable)
         Oh. Yeah, I was, um,--
                   JOKER                                      
         We don't have to talk about it.                      
Beat.

                   SOPHIE                                     
         Have you ever been fired before?                     
Joker thinks it over for a moment.

                   JOKER                                      
         Every time.                                          
                    SOPHIE                                    
         And have you ever wanted to torch                    
         the place?                                           
                   JOKER                                      
             (thinks it over again)                           
         Every time.                                          
Sophie smiles.

                   SOPHIE                                     
         Right. And this was like the first                   
         good job I had in like, years. Not                   
         waitressing or anything like that.                   
         It was 9-5. I had benefits. You                      
         know what that means when you have                   
         a kid?                                               
Joker just looks at her, he doesn't really know what that means. He just smiles.

                   SOPHIE                                     
         But from the very first day, the                     
         manager guy starts smiling at me,                    
         whispering in my ear, touching me,                   
         trying to get me to sleep with him--                 
                   JOKER                                      
             (interrupting)                                   
         Did you do it? Did you go to bed                     
         with him?                                            
                                                          48.

                   SOPHIE                                        
         Fuck no. The guy's a fucking pig.                       
         So finally I complained to his                          
         boss, and they fired me... And now,                     
         now I don't know what to do with                        
         myself.                                                 
                   JOKER                                         
         Right. Wait, what do you mean?                          
                   SOPHIE                                        
         I finally felt good. Like I had a                       
         future. A purpose. And now I don't                      
         even know how I'm gonna pay my                          
         rent.                                                   
AND JOKER STARTS LAUGHING. He puts a hand over his mouth trying to cover it, but he can't stop cracking up--

It's unsettling and disturbing for Sophie. People eating, waiters in red vests, busboys, all look over and stare at him. A few laugh. Joker turns away embarrassed, he looks out the plate-glass window, face turning red from laughing so hard--

AS HE LOOKS OUT, HE SEES A GROUP OF ROWDY KIDS walking down the street. One of them glances back before he turns the corner-- HE'S WEARING A CLOWN MASK THAT LOOKS JUST JOKER'S CLOWN FACE. And then he's gone. The group disappears around the corner--

Joker can't believe his eyes, still laughing-- He turns to Sophie who didn't see them. Just sits there awkwardly waiting for it to stop.

Finally, it subsides--

                   JOKER
             (catching his breath)
         I'm sorry. I have this thing--
                   SOPHIE                                        
         I know.                                                 
Awkward beat.

                   SOPHIE                                        
         How did you get it?
                   JOKER
         I don't know. I read you can get it
         from a brain injury or, or a lesion
         in there. My mom said I was born
         this way. Born laughing.
                                                               49.

                           SOPHIE
                 Is that why she calls you Happy?
                           JOKER
                 Kind of. That actually started when
                 I was a kid. The other kids made
                 fun of me, called me Happy-- but
                 not in a good way. I got so sick of
                 it, one day when I was about ten,
                 I, I,--
    He smiles.
                             SOPHIE
                 What?
                           JOKER
                 I took a razor and cut this smile
                 onto my face.
                     (she's taken aback as he
                      points to the scars)
                 Sort of like "You want happy? Here,
                 how's this for happy?"
    He looks down, still smiling. She just watches him for a
    beat.
                             SOPHIE
                 You okay?
                           JOKER
                 I've been thinking about this night
                 my whole life.
    They just sit there for a beat. Quiet.

49 INT. MOM'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 49

    Joker opening the door to his mother's apartment, holding a        
    doggie bag in his hand, sees the flickering blue light of the      
    TV on in the living room, hears the end of "LIVE WITH MURRAY
    FRANKLIN!" He locks the locks, drawing the security chain
    high on the door.
    TURNS TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF HIS MOTHER PASSED OUT in the
    living room, the cat jumping up next to her on the chair.
    Joker watches for a beat as Murray does his signature sign
    off, the one he's been doing for years--
                                                       50.

                   MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)
             (looking into camera)
         Good night! And always remember,--
         That's life.
                   JOKER
             (quietly)
         "That's life."
He hears Don Ellis and his Jazz Orchestra playing the show's closing song-- the instrumental version of Frank Sinatra's "That's Life".

As the music continues, Joker puts his face up against his mom's nose, to see if she's breathing or if she's dead.

He feels her breath against his cheek.

Now he picks his mother up in his arms and carries her into her bedroom to the music, almost as if he's dancing with her as he leaves the room...

We stay behind.

"That's Life" still playing from TV.

He comes back into the living room and turns off the TV. Takes off his jacket and throws it on the couch. Notices something sticking out of his jacket pocket. He pulls it out.

It's the envelope he was supposed to deliver to Thomas Wayne.

He stares at it for a beat. And then--

Quietly rips it open, starts to read the letter:

CLOSE ON WORDS, "Dearest Thomas, I don't know where else to turn..."

"Need your help..."

"You have a son. We have a son. His name is Arthur."

Stops reading, stays on--

"You have a son."

JOKER STARING DOWN AT THE LETTER, reading those words over and over again -- "You have a son."

                                                  CUT TO:
                                                            51.

50 INT. MOM'S BEDROOM, APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING 50

    JOKER'S SITTING IN A CHAIR in his mother's room watching her
    sleep. He has clearly been up all night. Still wearing the
    same clothes.
    He's holding her letter in his hand as the sun is just
    starting to rise outside the windows, light just beginning to
    crack the gloom.
    THE ORANGE CAT SITS AT HIS FEET staring up at him, won't take
    her eyes off of him.
    Joker impatiently sits there for another moment waiting for
    his mother to wake up, then suddenly--
    SHRIEKS OUT AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS like a teapot, kicking
    his back on the chair like an excited toddler--
    His mother wakes with a start, looking around half asleep and
    confused--
    Joker turns and sees the cat run out of the room--
                        MOM
              --what, what time is it?
    He doesn't answer.
                        MOM
              What happened? Did you hurt
              yourself again?
    Joker holds her letter up in his hand.
                        JOKER
              What is this? How come you never
              told me?
                        MOM
              Is, is that my letter? Is that my
              letter, Happy?
                        JOKER
              How could you not tell me, Ma?
                        MOM
              You told me you dropped it off.
              You have no right opening my mail.
              Who do you think you are?
                        JOKER
                  (raising his voice;
                   excited)
                        (MORE)
                                                       52.
                   JOKER (CONT'D)
         Apparently I'm Thomas Wayne's son!
         How could you keep that from me?
His mother slowly getting up out of bed.

                   MOM
         Stop yelling at me, you're gonna
         kill me, give me a heart attack!
She goes into the bathroom.

                   JOKER
             (shouts after her)
         I'm not yelling! I'm just, excited.
         How can any of this be real!? How
         can Thomas Wayne be my father?
                    MOM (OS)
             (shouts back from behind
              the door)
         I'm not talking to you until you
         calm down.
Joker sits for a minute then gets up and goes to her bathroom door. Talks to his mother from the behind the closed door.

                   JOKER
             (lowers his voice; trying
              to sound calm)
         Okay. How's this, Mom? Better? Will
         you please talk to me?
Joker leans in closer to the door. Leaning against it with just his head--

                   JOKER
         Please.
                   MOM (OS)
         He is an extraordinary man, Arthur.
         We had a connection. I was so
         beautiful then. We were in love.
Joker just leans there, listening. He closes his eyes, it's all too much.

                    MOM (OS)
         His wife could see it. She was
         jealous from the moment I started
         working there. She fired me before
         I even knew I was pregnant with
         you.
              (hear her crying now)
                    (MORE)
                                                               53.
                         MOM (OS) (CONT'D)
              And, I never told him or anybody
              because, well, you can imagine what
              people would say about Thomas and
              me, and, and what they would say
              about you.
                        JOKER
                  (eyes still closed, head
                   leaning against the door)
              What would they say, Ma?
                        MOM (OS)
              That I was a whore, and Thomas
              Wayne was a fornicator, and that
              you're a little, unwanted bastard.
    AND THE BATHROOM DOOR SUDDENLY SWINGS OPEN, and Joker falls
    face first into the bathroom--
    Just missing his mother, crashing down onto the floor--
                                                         CUT TO:

51 EXT. BOARDWALK, AMUSEMENT MILE - MORNING 51

    Joker heads down the boardwalk toward Ha-Ha's, a bounce in
    his step.
    Looming behind him like the skeletons of monsters, a
    sprawling rickety-looking wooden roller coaster and the
    gigantic steel Wonder Wheel in the amusement park by the
    ocean. Sound of waves crashing, seagulls squawking.

52 INT. HA-HA'S TALENT BOOKING, LOCKER ROOM - MORNING 52

    Joker walks into the locker room, sees Randall half-dressed
    for work, red nose, big pants, big shoes, no wig yet, sitting
    with Gary, TWO OTHER CLOWNS AND A MAGICIAN around the small
    table, shooting the shit, drinking coffee.
    They nod hello at Joker or give him a perfunctory wave, most
    of his co-workers think he's a freak.
                        GARY
              Hey Art, I heard what happened--
              I'm sorry man.
                        RANDALL
              Yeah, Hoyt did you wrong, buddy.
              Doesn't seem fair.
                                                         54.

Joker looks hard at Randall for a moment, just slowly nods, and continues on to his locker.

He starts to clean it out, stuffing all of his clown gear into an old brown paper shopping bag. Hears them talking about him behind his back, about why he got fired, laughing at him--

                   HA-HA CLOWN #1 (OS)
         Did you really bring a gun to the
         kid's hospital, Artie? What the
         fuck would you do that for?
Joker doesn't answer them, just continues emptying his locker, a bag of balloons, a magic wand, some trick flowers--

                   HA-HA CLOWN #2
         No, I heard he pulled it out and
         waved it around like a cowboy.
His co-workers crack up. Joker answers the guy without looking back--

                   JOKER
         It was a prop gun. And I didn't
         pull it out, it fell out.
                   MAGICIAN
         So is that part of your new act? If
         your singing doesn't do the trick,
         you just gonna shoot yourself?                         
More laughter.

                   HA-HA CLOWN #2
         I thought Jingles was a lover not a
         fighter.
Joker turns and looks at all of them, nods at Randall--

                   JOKER
         Why don't you ask Randall about it?
         It was his idea.
                   GARY
             (to Randall)
         Since when do you use a prop gun?
                   RANDALL
         What? I don't. Stop talking outta
         your ass, Art!
             (to the guys)
                   (MORE)
                                                            55.
                         RANDALL (CONT'D)
              I think all his stupid laughing
              musta scrambled his brain or                           
              something.
    The guys laugh and keep jawing. Joker doesn't say anything.
    Just finishes packing his bag and closes his locker door--

53 EXT. HA-HA'S, BACK ALLEY - AMUSEMENT MILE BOARDWALK - MORNING

                                                              53
    Joker exits the back door holding onto his brown shopping bag
    under his arm, starts down the alley.
    Behind him, Randall hustles out and chases down the alley
    after him, still half-dressed for work.
                        RANDALL
                  (calling out)
              Art! Hold up,--
    As he catches up with Joker his red nose falls off, but he's
    so out of breath he doesn't realize he lost it--
                        RANDALL
              What the fuck was that about?
    Beat.
                        JOKER
              What?
                        RANDALL
              Why would you say that? That, that                     
              it was my idea.                                        
    Joker just looks back at Randall. Sees his red Styrofoam nose
    bouncing down the alley behind him.
                        JOKER

                        RANDALL                                      
              You don't get it, do you, buddy,                       
              that shit that went down on the                        
              subway, that's no joke. They got                       
              clown sketches on the front of                         
              every fucking paper. It's just a                       
              matter of time before the cops come                    
              around.                                                
    Beat.

              I don't know anything about it.

                  (leans in close; lowers
                   his voice)
              Art, you know you're my boy. I'm                        
              not gonna say shit. I just hope you                     
              got rid of that gun. That can't                         
              come back on me, okay?                                  
                        JOKER
              Randall, I didn't shoot anybody.
              That wasn't me. And I don't have
              time for this, I got somebody real
              important I gotta go see.
    Joker turns to go--
                        RANDALL
              You know they're sellin' masks.
                        JOKER
                  (turning back around)
              What?
                        RANDALL
              They're selling masks of your clown

                          RANDALL
              What?
    Randall touches his face. Realizes his nose is not there.
    Joker points to Randall's clown nose tumbling back down the
    alley. And Randall hustles after it, chasing after his red
    nose blowing skipping away in the wind--

54 INT. METRO TRAIN (MOVING) - COUNTRYSIDE, OUTSIDE GOTHAM - 54

    NEXT AFTERNOON
    CLOSE ON NEW "KILLER CLOWN" SKETCH ON FRONT PAGE OF THAT
    DAY'S TABLOID, a more detailed drawing.
                                                            57.

    HEADLINE, "KILLER CLOWN STILL ON THE LOOSE!"
    SUB-HEAD, "'Kill the Rich' -- A New Movement?"
    ANGLE ON JOKER LOOKING DOWN AT HIS NOTEBOOK, STARING AT A
    PHOTOGRAPH OF THOMAS WAYNE RIPPED OUT FROM A MAGAZINE, taped
    to a page. He glances at his distorted reflection in the
    window, takes his hand and parts his hair to the side, more
    like Thomas Wayne's hair. Maybe there is a resemblance.
    WIDER ANGLE, train is packed with wealthy white businessmen
    and a couple businesswomen heading home after work, many of
    them reading the same tabloid. The "Killer Clown" sketch of
    Joker's clown face dots the train. No empty seats -- except
    the one next to Joker.

55 INT. TAXI CAB (MOVING), COUNTRYSIDE - AFTERNOON 55

    JOKER IN THE BACK OF A TAXI STARING OUT AT THE COUNTRYSIDE,        
    at the trees and green grass and blue sky and open spaces
    whizzing by. The sun is getting low, bathing everything in a
    golden light.
    He doesn't see garbage anywhere.

56 EXT. WAYNE MANOR, FRONT LAWN - MAGIC HOUR 56

    Joker walking along an intimidating wrought iron fence,            
    surrounding the estate like prison bars, the brown paper           
    shopping bag stuffed under his arm. The big house set up a         
    small hill, evergreens dot the lush grounds. As he walks
    around looking for the front entrance, Joker catches a
    glimpse of an innocent looking EIGHT-YEAR-OLD BOY tracking         
    him from behind the trees, hiding as he follows.
    Joker stops.
    He sees the boy stop behind a tree.
    Joker continues walking until he gets to the front gate. He
    digs into his bag and pulls out the magic wand--
    He holds it up for the boy to see.
    The boy steps out from behind a tree to get a closer look.
    Joker puts the brown bag down on the ground, looks over the        
    wand, pretending like he's trying to figure out what it does.
    He waves the wand over the front gate lock to "try and see"
    if it will open-- It doesn't.
                                                          58.

The little boy walks down toward the fence, face like an angel.

Joker waits until he gets closer and then reaches his hand through the fence and hands the kid his magic wand so he can try and figure out what it does--

The boy takes the wand and it goes limp in his hand before he can wave it-- He laughs, surprised. He hands it back to Joker.

The boys sees Joker's face up close, staring at his scarred smile--

Joker straightens the wand back out, and reaches in through the fence again so the kid can give it another try.

AND AGAIN THE MAGIC WAND DROOPS IN THE BOY'S HAND. He laughs and gives it back to Joker--

Joker examines the wand as if its "broken", stiffens it one last time, crouches down lower, and...

Ta-da! A bouquet of flowers bursts out the end of the wand--

Joker smiles and hands him the wand bouquet of flowers--

The little boy takes the flowers. Keeps staring at Joker, at the scars around his mouth.

Now, he reaches his hand out through the fence and touches Joker's face, tracing his finger around the edges of Joker's mouth, over his scarred smile--

Joker closes his eyes -- embarrassed -- but it feels good to him, nobody ever touches him besides his mother.

He starts to smile, when a man's voice shatters the moment--

                   ALFRED (OS)                                   
             (shouting; slight English                           
              accent)                                            
         Bruce! What are you doing? Get away                     
         from that man.                                          
The little boy pulls his hand back. Turns and runs away--

Joker looks up and sees a balding, tired-looking, ALFRED PENNYWORTH (50's) bounding down the hill toward them.

Joker stands back up.

                                                          59.

                   ALFRED                                        
             (still shouting)                                    
         What are you doing? Who are you?                        
Little Bruce runs behind Alfred, hiding behind his legs.

                   JOKER                                         
         My name's Arthur. I'm here to see                       
         Mr. Wayne--                                             
                   ALFRED                                        
             (interrupting)                                      
         You shouldn't be talking to his                         
         son. Why did you give him those                         
         flowers?                                                
Alfred takes the flower-wand away from the kid--

                   JOKER                                         
         I, I was just trying to make him                        
         laugh.                                                  
He hands it back to Joker.

                   ALFRED                                        
         Well it's not funny. Do I need to                       
         call the police?                                        
                   JOKER                                         
         No, please. My mother's name is                         
         Penny Fleck. She used to work here,                     
         years ago. Can you tell Mr. Wayne                       
         that I need to see him?                                 
                   ALFRED                                        
             (color drains from his
              face; beat)
         You're her son?                                         
                   JOKER                                         
         Did you know her?                                       
Alfred doesn't say anything.

Joker puts his face right up against the bars, whispers so the boy can't hear him--

                   JOKER                                         
         You don't need to cover for them.                       
         I'm sure Mrs. Wayne was very upset                      
         when she found out.                                     
                                                            60.

                        ALFRED
              There was nothing to find out                            
              about. Your mother was, was                              
              delusional. She was a sick woman.                        
                        JOKER                                          
              No. No, just let me speak to Mr.                         
              Wayne.                                                   
    Now Alfred leans in closer to Joker, almost looks like he          
    feels some pity for him--                                          
                        ALFRED                                         
              Please just go, before you make a                        
              fool of yourself.
    Beat.
                        JOKER
                  (blurts out)
              Thomas Wayne is my father--
    Alfred looks at Joker, and can't help but crack up laughing        
    at him.                                                            
    AND JOKER REACHES THROUGH THE BARS AND GRABS HIM. Pulls him        
    in close, trying to choke him, still holding the wand of           
    flowers in one hand--                                              
    AS HE CHOKES ALFRED, Joker sees little Bruce, wide-eyed in         
    the shadows, looking out at him in horror.                         
    Joker stops.
    Lets go of Alfred... Takes off running back down the street        
    away from Wayne Manor, magic wand in hand, leaving the rest        
    of his clown gear behind.                                          
                                                       CUT TO:

57 EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE, STREETS - NIGHT 57

    JOKER'S BACK IN HIS PART OF TOWN, garbage everywhere here.
    The neighborhood at night is alive. Loud kids on the street
    corners... A drunk seemingly fights no one... Hookers working
    the street... He hears a wailing siren...
    As Joker turns the corner, he sees AN AMBULANCE PARKED in
    front of his building. Lights flashing. Hit with a sense of
    dread, he runs toward the building--
                                                            61.

58 EXT. STREET, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 58

    A SMALL CROWD OF GAWKERS have gathered around watching the
    drama unfold. Shouting and laughing, loud dance music blaring
    out an open window, feels like an impromptu block party.
    Joker runs up, sees his mother being wheeled down the front
    steps unconscious on a stretcher, AN EMT holding an oxygen
    bag on her face. TWO DETECTIVES IN PLAIN SUITS following
    behind them. It's a chaotic scene.
    FROM ABOVE, Joker pushing through the crowd, rushes to his
    mother's side. We don't hear what he says to the paramedics
    over the music and the crowd, just see them nod okay and
    Joker follow after them into the back of the ambulance--

59 INT. CITY AMBULANCE, BACK (PARKED) - NIGHT 59

    Joker looking out the back doors as they start to shut close--
    CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF SOPHIE, coming out of the building. He
    stares at her through the small back door window. Casually
    waves at her, trying to connect with her--
    Joker sees the two detectives approaching Sophie as the
    ambulance pulls away. Speeding away down the street, siren
    wailing--
                                                       CUT TO:

60 INT. CITY HOSPITAL, EMERGENCY TREATMENT ROOM - NIGHT 60

    Joker's standing near the doorway of a large overcrowded
    treatment room. Watching a sleep-deprived ER RESIDENT (late
    20's), and an EMERGENCY NURSE start to intubate his mother.
    He hears shouts and cries of pain from around the crowded
    room.
    Joker turns away when he sees them insert a thin endotracheal
    tube into her mouth and down through her larynx. It makes him
    gag--

61 EXT. CITY HOSPITAL, ER - NIGHT 61

    Joker sits on a bench outside the bustling emergency room.
    He's getting some fresh air, but he picked a weird spot to do
    it.
    He watches the sick and dying being rushed through the glass
    doors. Opening and closing. This happens in the background
    throughout the scene.
                                                       62.

The two detectives walk up to Joker, interrupting him watching the doors. Gotham police detectives, GARRITY (50's), grey hair, and BURKE (30's), his partner.

                   DET. GARRITY
         Mr. Fleck, sorry to bother you, I'm
         Detective Garrity, this is my
         partner Detective Burke.
Joker looks up at them. Doesn't say anything.

                   DET. GARRITY
         We had a few questions for you, but
         you weren't home. So we spoke to
         your mother.
                   JOKER
         You did this to her?
                   DET. GARRITY
         What? No. We just asked her some
         questions and she started getting
         hysterical-- hyperventilating,
         trouble speaking-- then she
         collapsed. Hit her head pretty
         hard.
                   JOKER
         They told me she had a stroke.
Beat.

                   DET. GARRITY
         Sorry to hear that.
AND JOKER BURSTS OUT LAUGHING, he can't stop it.

The detectives are taken aback. They don't know what to make of him laughing. They share a look.

                   DET. BURKE
             (confused)
         I'm lost. Is something funny?
                   JOKER
             (laughter choking up in
              his throat)
         No I,-- I have a, a--
Tears rolling down his face, he takes out one of his cards and hands it to Det. Burke. Burke glances over the card, a skeptical look on his face.

                                                       63.

                   DET. BURKE
         Okay. But we have some questions
         for you.
                   DET. GARRITY
         About those subway killings from a
         few weeks ago.
Joker pauses for a moment, his laughter subsiding. He holds his breath.

                   JOKER
         I don't know anything about that.
                   DET. GARRITY
         We have an eyewitness who described
         a white male, about 6 feet tall, in
         clown make up. Or a clown mask.
         Spoke to your boss at Ha-Ha's, Mr.
         Vaughn, and he said you were on a
         job the day of the shooting.
Joker's still holding his breath, he nods yes.

                   DET. GARRITY
             (just continues)
         He also said you got fired that
         day,-- For bringing a gun into the
         children's hospital.
And Joker cracks up again, his laughter coming back harder-- He covers his mouth with his hand, shaking his head no, his face now turning red.

                   DET. GARRITY
         You weren't fired?
Joker catches his breath as the intensity of his laughter starts to wane, petering out.

                   JOKER
         Not for having a gun. That was prop
         gun. Part of my act.
Joker's laughter finally stops for good.

                   DET. BURKE
         So why were you fired?
                   JOKER
         They said I wasn't funny.
The detectives share another look.

                                                            64.

    Joker stands up.
                        JOKER
              Now, if you don't mind, I have to
              go back and look after my mother.
    Detective Burke steps close to him, holds up the card that
    Joker handed him--
                        DET. BURKE
              Hey lemme ask you a question? This
              condition of yours,-- Is this real
              or is this like some sorta clown
              thing?
                        JOKER
              Clown thing?
                        DET. BURKE
              I mean, is it part of your act?
                        JOKER
              What do you think?
    And Joker walks away-- heads for the sliding glass doors.
    Only the motion detector doesn't engage--
    AND HE SLAMS RIGHT INTO THE GLASS DOOR.
    HARD.
    He bounces back.

62 INT. HALLWAY, NURSE'S STATION - CITY HOSPITAL - NIGHT 62

    Joker walking down the hallway, ER flooded with the poor and
    uninsured. Overwhelmed doctors and nurses trying their best
    to keep up. He stops at the busy nurse's station, and stands
    there for a moment, trying to get a nurse's attention--
                        JOKER
              Excuse me, I was wondering how I
              could check my mother out of here?
    One of the nurses at the desk looks up at him, seems slightly
    annoyed.
                        ER NURSE
              What's your mother's name?
                        JOKER
              Penny Fleck. I'd like to take her
              home.
                                                       65.

The sleep-deprived ER RESIDENT who was working on his mother overhears Joker, comes over to talk to him with a clipboard in his hand. Joker recognizes him--

                   ER RESIDENT
         Mr. Fleck, your mother had a
         stroke. It's very serious. You
         can't "check her out." She's gonna
         be here for at least a week.
                   JOKER
         She's not gonna wanna stay that
         long. She doesn't like hospitals.
         Or doctors.
                   ER RESIDENT
         I'm sorry to hear that. But she
         can't just leave.
                   JOKER
         I don't like hospitals either.
Beat.

The resident just nods okay. Looks down at his clipboard--

                   ER RESIDENT
         Listen, I wanted to talk you about
         something we noticed in her tox
         report. We found heavy traces of
         multiple medications in her system.
                   JOKER
         Okay. Thanks.
He turns to go, but the resident continues--

                   ER RESIDENT
         One of them's perphenazine. It's a
         powerful anti-psychotic. If she was
         taking that regularly and then
         suddenly stopped, the withdrawal
         could have contributed to her
         stroke. Did you notice any
         symptoms?
                     JOKER
         Symptoms?
                   ER RESIDENT
         Withdrawal symptoms. Nausea...
         anxiety... hallucinations.
Joker shakes his head, no.

                                                             66.

                         ER RESIDENT
              Do you know how long she's been
              taking it?
    Joker shakes his head no again, leans in closer to the
    resident--
                         JOKER
              Can you tell me what those symptoms
              are again?
                                                         CUT TO:

63 INT. PATIENT BAY, EMERGENCY TREATMENT ROOM - NIGHT 63

    CLOSE ON TV, Murray Franklin is in the middle of doing his
    monologue.
                        MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)
              So I told my youngest son, Tommy,
              remember he's the 'not so bright'
              one,--
                  (laughter)
              I told him that the garbage strike
              is still going on. And he says, and
              I'm not kidding, Tommy says, "So
              where are we gonna get all our
              garbage from?"
    Murray Franklin cracks up at his own joke. Studio audience
    laughs.
    JOKER LAUGHS, LYING IN BED NEXT TO HIS UNCONSCIOUS MOTHER in
    the large overcrowded treatment room.
    Blue curtain dividers separate the bays. He's watching the
    show on a TV bolted high on the wall. He glances over at his
    mother, laughing over the sounds of her labored breath, the
    pain and suffering of those around him.
    He looks back up at the television.
                        MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)
              And finally, in a world where
              everyone thinks they could do my
              job, we got this videotape from the
              Gotham Comedy Club. Here's a guy
              who thinks if you just keep
              laughing, it'll somehow make you
              funny. Check out this joker.
                                                         67.

EXTREME CLOSE ON TV, GRAINY VIDEO OF JOKER'S STAND-UP PERFORMANCE. Joker on stage smiling behind the microphone, under the harsh spotlight.

Joker watching himself on TV, his jaw drops--

                    JOKER (ON TV)
             (trying to stop himself
              from laughing)
         -- good evening, hello.
             (deep breath; trying to
              stop laughing)
         Good to be here.
             (keeps cracking up)
         I, I hated school as a kid. But my
         mother would always say,--
             (bad imitation of his mom,
              still laughing)
         "You should enjoy it. One day
         you'll have to work for a living."
             (laughs)
         "No I won't, Ma. I'm gonna be a
         comedian!"
Back to Murray Franklin shaking his head, trying not to laugh.

                   MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)
         You should have listened to your
         mother.
The studio audience erupts into laughter.

ANGLE ON JOKER, watching Murray Franklin make fun of him on TV. He gets up and starts walking toward the TV set as if in a trance. Unsure if this is really happening.

                   MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)
         One more, Bernie. Let's see one
         more. I love this guy.
The tape continues of Joker at the comedy club.

                    JOKER (ON TV)
         It's funny, when I was a little boy
         and told people I wanted to be a
         comedian, everyone laughed at me.
             (opens his arms like a big
              shot)
         Well no one is laughing now.
Dead silence. Nobody is laughing. Not even him.

CUT BACK CLOSE ON MURRAY FRANKLIN, just shaking his head.

                                                             68.

                        MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)
              You can say that again, pal!
    Murray cracks up and the studio audience laughs along with
    him.
    CLOSE ON JOKER, looking up at the television, hearing them
    all laughing at him.
    Beat.
                                                       JUMP CUT:
    Joker is dragging a chair to the television set.
    In a rage, he gets up on the chair and tries to pull the TV
    out of the wall, as the show continues to play--
    But the set is firmly secured to the wall, and Joker pulls so
    hard the chair flips from underneath him and he goes flying
    up the air, crashing down hard onto the floor.

64 INT. CAFETERIA, CITY HOSPITAL - EARLY MORNING 64

    Joker walks with a plastic tray of food. Some runny eggs and
    a coffee. He keeps his head down so no one can see his face.
    There are a few DOCTORS AND NURSES sitting and chatting at
    one table. A group of ORDERLIES are sitting together at
    another table.
    He goes and sits down in the far corner, far away from
    everyone else. Sees a tabloid newspaper left on the table,
    and picks it up to read so he doesn't seem so alone.
    ANGLE ON FRONT PAGE HEADLINE, "Thomas Wayne Announces Run",
    over a full-page campaign-style photograph of Thomas Wayne
    waving to a crowd standing next to his wife, MARTHA (50's), a
    severe looking, well-preserved former model, and little Bruce
    Wayne standing in front of them. Photo catches Bruce looking
    into camera, eyes wide, scared by the crowd.
    SUB-HEADLINE READS, "Protest Planned at Wayne Hall Opening
    Tonight"
    Joker stares at the family photo.
    CLOSE ON BRUCE WAYNE IN PHOTO, Joker's fingers ripping his
    picture out of the front page.
                        YOUNG DOCTOR (OS)
              -- I'm sorry to bother you, but can
              you settle an argument for us?
                                                              69.

    CLOSE ON JOKER LOOKING UP, interrupted from ripping out the
    picture. One YOUNG DOCTOR and TWO NURSES are standing around
    him. We stay with Joker, don't see their faces. Just their
    bodies, all dressed in green scrubs, uniforms.
                           JOKER
              Excuse me?
                        YOUNG DOCTOR (OS)
              You were the guy on Murray Franklin
              last night, right?
    He hears the nurses giggle.
                        JOKER
              No, sorry. Wasn't me.
                        NURSE #1 (OS)
              Of course it was you. You were the
              comedian.
                        YOUNG DOCTOR (OS)
              Except you weren't funny. You
              didn't tell any jokes.
    He hears the nurses giggle again.
    STAY CLOSE ON JOKER, getting upset. He just shakes his head.
                        JOKER
              I don't know what you're talking
              about.
                        YOUNG DOCTOR (OS)
              No. It was definitely you, buddy.
              You're the guy who couldn't stop
              laughing. Murray killed you.
    More laughter. Joker looks up at them.
                        JOKER
              If I were you, I'd walk away from
              this table before I strangle all
              three of you with that fucking
              stethoscope hanging from your neck.
    Beat.

65 EXT. CENTER FOR PERFORMING ARTS, WAYNE HALL - UPTOWN - DUSK

                                                              65
    Joker crosses a busy street heading to the Center for
    Performing Arts. Light falling. Storm clouds gathering.
                                                               70.

    Joker stops when he sees--
    A CROWD OF PROTESTERS SCREAMING AND SHOUTING IN FRONT OF
    WAYNE HALL, behind steel barricades. Many wearing Joker's
    "clown face" mask... A few wave homemade signs, "CLOWN FOR
    MAYOR"... "KILL THE RICH"... "MR. WAYNE, AM I A CLOWN?"
    A LINE OF POLICEMEN AND SECURITY GUARDS stand between the
    crowd and the lit-up white marble building.
    Joker watches the protest for a moment, then continues across
    the street. It starts to rain.

66 EXT. WAYNE HALL, FRONT ENTRANCE - EVENING 66

    A FIGHT BREAKS OUT between a "clown" masked protester and two
    cops. The crowd goes crazy, pushing through the barricades
    toward the building in the driving rain. The police and Wayne
    Hall Security fight to keep them out--
    Amidst all the chaos, we glimpse Joker slipping into the
    building unnoticed--

67 INT. LOBBY, WAYNE HALL - EVENING 67

    Joker walks through the massive multi-level lobby. It's
    completely empty since the performance has already begun and
    whatever security was available is outside helping the police
    deal with the protesters.
    He looks up in awe at the crystal chandeliers... The shiny,
    marble floor beneath his feet. He's never seen anything this
    opulent in his entire life.

68 INT. BACK OF THEATER, WAYNE HALL - EVENING 68

    JOKER MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE DARK SHADOWS ALONG THE BACK
    WALL OF THE AUDITORIUM, looking for Thomas Wayne in the sold-
    out black-tie audience--
    He catches bits of Chaplin's MODERN TIMES projected on a
    screen behind the Gotham Philharmonic playing the silent
    movie's score... the Tramp roller skating blindfolded on a
    date with the Gamin (Paulette Goddard) in a department store.
    He continues moving along the wall from aisle-to-aisle
    looking for Thomas Wayne...
    The audience laughs as the Tramp skates blindfolded, skirting
    along the edge of a balcony with no rail, orchestra playing
    the bouncy score. Joker can't find Thomas Wayne in the dark--
                                                            71.

    He moves to the top of the next aisle, pausing to watch more
    of the film. Suddenly somebody bumps into Joker--
    He looks up and sees it's one of Thomas Wayne's TWO SECURITY
    GUARDS, escorting Thomas Wayne out of the auditorium--
    Joker turns and watches them lead him out. Behind Joker on
    screen, the Tramp is rescued by the girl before he falls off
    the edge, orchestra swelling--

69 INT. LOBBY, WAYNE HALL - CONTINUOUS 69

    Joker peeks his head out of the auditorium, sees Thomas Wayne
    heading into the men's room, his two security guards waiting
    by the door, still hear the orchestra playing the score--
    Joker glances back into the auditorium--
    Sees a lobby broom and upright dustpan tucked in the back
    corner--

70 INT. HALLWAY, MEN'S ROOM - WAYNE HALL - SECONDS LATER 70

    Joker's sweeping up the hallway with his head down, hear the
    orchestra playing the melancholy "Smile" from the film's
    score. He sweeps along to the music like Emmett Kelly's
    famous hobo clown... Sweeping around the two security guards'
    feet... Annoyed, they move a bit away from the bathroom
    door... And don't give Joker a second look as he heads
    inside...

71 INT. MEN'S ROOM, WAYNE HALL - CONTINUOUS 71

    Joker sweeps his way into the cavernous, black & white tiled
    bathroom, ornate gold fixtures. It's empty save for Thomas
    Wayne peeing at the far end of a long line of urinals.
    Joker takes a deep breath, and walks down the line of urinals
    right up next to Thomas Wayne--
    He stands there for a beat while Thomas urinates, lobby broom
    and upright dustpan in hand--
                        THOMAS WAYNE
                  (glances over; annoyed)
              Can I help you, pal?
                        JOKER
              What? Yeah. No I, I--
                                                        72.

                    THOMAS WAYNE
             (interrupting)
         You need to get in here or
         something?
Thomas Wayne finishes and zips his fly back up. Joker is not sure what to say to him, just says--

                   JOKER
         Dad. It's me.
Beat.

But Thomas Wayne doesn't hear him, he was flushing the urinal. He walks toward the sink.

                      THOMAS WAYNE
         Excuse me?
Joker follows after him.

                    JOKER
         My name is Arthur. I'm Penny's son.
             (beat)
         I know you didn't know about me,
         and I don't want anything from you.
         Well... maybe a hug.
And Joker smiles, it's all very emotional for him. Thomas looks over at him like he's fucking crazy.

                   THOMAS WAYNE
         Jesus? You're the guy who came by
         my house yesterday.
Joker nods, relieved he finally broke through.

                   JOKER
         Yes. But they wouldn't let me in,
         wouldn't let me see you. So I came
         here. I have so many questions.
Thomas Wayne just laughs to himself and turns on the gold faucets at one of the sinks.

                   THOMAS WAYNE
         Look pal, I'm not your father.
         What's wrong with you?
                   JOKER
         How do you know?
Thomas Wayne just keeps washing his hands, doesn't even look over at Joker.

                                                        73.

                   THOMAS WAYNE
         Cause you were adopted. And I never
         fucked your mother. What do you
         want from me, money?
                   JOKER
         No. What? I wasn't adopted.
Thomas starts drying his hands.

                   THOMAS WAYNE
         She never told you? Your mother
         adopted you before she even started
         working for us. She was arrested
         when you were four years old and
         committed to Arkham State Hospital.
         She's batshit crazy.
Joker starts to smile, feels a laugh coming on.

                   JOKER
         No. No, I don't believe that.
Thomas finishes drying his hands. Turns to Joker, his tone way more serious now.

                   THOMAS WAYNE
         I don't really give a shit   what you
         believe.
             (steps in closer)
         But if you ever come to my   house
         again, if you ever talk to   my son
         again, if I ever even hear   about
         you again, I'll--
AND JOKER CRACKS UP LAUGHING, interrupting his threat. Laughing right in his face--

                   THOMAS WAYNE
         Are you laughing at me?
Joker's laughing so hard he can't answer.

THOMAS SHOVES JOKER HARD UP AGAINST THE TILED WALL, gripping his neck with one hand. Joker just cracks up louder, he drops the dustpan and broom--

                   THOMAS WAYNE
             (shouting)
         You think this is funny?
Thomas Wayne's security guards bang open the door, rushing into the bathroom when they hear the shouting--

                                                              74.

    They stop when they see Thomas has Joker jacked up against
    the wall.
                        JOKER
                  (tries shaking his head
                   no; still laughing and
                   choking)
              No, no I have a con--
                        THOMAS WAYNE
                  (interrupting; raising his
                   voice)
              Is this a fucking joke to you?
    AND THOMAS WAYNE PUNCHES JOKER STRAIGHT IN THE FACE with his
    free hand, blood spraying from his nose--

72 EXT. WAYNE HALL, FRONT ENTRANCE - PLAZA - NIGHT 72

    The two security guards roughly throw Joker out of the hall,
    right in front of the drenched crowd of screaming protesters,
    TV cameras and photographers now on hand, bulbs flashing--
    Joker knowing how to take a fall, plays it up in front of
    this audience for all it's worth, tumbling end-over-end out
    onto the plaza in the rain--
    He rolls to his feet with a bit of panache and brushes
    himself off like it was nothing.
    The protesters go crazy, cheering and applauding his act--
    And Joker takes a deep dramatic bow. Wet hair. Bloody nose.
    He turns and sees the security guards coming back out--
    Joker takes off running through the plaza in the downpour,
    running out of the Center for Performing Arts. Turns down a
    side street almost slipping--
    And keeps running even though nobody's chasing after him.
    We HEAR the familiar beats of THE SUGARHILL GANG'S "Apache"
    as Joker just keeps running and running.

73 INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY - NIGHT 73

    Joker knocking on Sophie's apartment door, "Apache" blaring
    inside. He's soaking wet, clothes clinging to his body.
    There's no answer.
                                                              75.

    He knocks again. Hard to hear anything over the loud music.
    Now he tries the door. It's unlocked.

74 INT. SOPHIE'S APARTMENT, FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS 74

    Joker walks into Sophie's apartment, "Apache" thumping,
    lights dim.
                        JOKER
              Sophie?
    WALKS INTO THE DARK LIVING ROOM, catches a glimpse of Sophie,
    naked riding on top of SOME GUY on the couch--
    The guy sees Joker standing in the shadows and jumps. Sophie
    turns and sees Joker as well. She screams--

75 INT. HALLWAY, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 75

    Joker rushing for his mother's apartment.
    Behind him, the guy comes out half naked into the hallway,
    zipping up his pants, screaming at Joker--
    Joker doesn't look back, doesn't hear the guy yelling at him--
    Quickly opens the door to his mother's apartment and hurries
    inside.

76 EXT. ARKHAM STATE HOSPITAL - MORNING 76

    A GRAY, BEHEMOTH STATE HOSPITAL looming over the city block.
    Metal screens cover steel-framed windows. Joker crosses the
    street toward the building, eyes weary, he hasn't slept in
    days.
    HE SEES TWO GOTHAM CITY COPS AND A PARAMEDIC rolling a gurney
    into the entrance... a naked, sunburned man screaming his
    head off is handcuffed to the stretcher underneath a white
    sheet. Joker follows them inside.

77 INT. ARKHAM STATE HOSPITAL - ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE - MORNING

                                                              77
    Joker sits waiting in a cramped office, looking out a
    plexiglass window that overlooks the crowded hallway--
                                                         76.

A constant din of people moving about, talking and shouting. Patients handcuffed to the armrests of their wheelchairs, lying on stretchers, heads covered with pillowcase turbans or forearms to block out the harsh fluorescent lights.

His gaze is interrupted by a CLERK (40's), ID clipped to his shirt, who's lugging an old heavy file storage box.

He drops the box down on his messy desk with a thud.

                   CLERK
         Sorry for the wait. All our records
         that are 10 years or older are
         stored in the basement. You're
         talking over 30 years ago,-- I had                     
         to do some serious digging.
Joker nods thanks.

                   CLERK
         Like I said, if it's in here, I'm
         still gonna need a release from
         her.
The clerk opens the file box. Starts digging though it. Joker stares out the plexiglass window that faces the hallway--

         Can I ask you a question? How does
         someone wind up in here? Have all
         these people committed crimes?
                   CLERK
             (going through the files)
         Some have. Some are just crazy and
         pose a danger to themselves or
         others. Some just got nowhere else
         to go.
Beat.

                   JOKER
             (nods; looks down)
         Yeah, I know how that is. Sometimes
         I don't know what to do, y'know, I
         don't think I can take any more of
         this.
The clerk is half listening as he scans the paper work.

                   CLERK
         Yeah, I can't take much more of
         this shit either.
                   (MORE)
                                                          77.
                   CLERK (CONT'D)
         Now they talking about more
         layoffs, man, we're understaffed as
         it is. I don't know what I'm gonna
         do.
Joker looks up at the guy, thinking he's made a connection.

                   JOKER
         Last time I ended up taking it out
         on some,-- people. Bad shit. I
         thought it would bother me but, it
         really hasn't.
For the first time, the clerk looks at him--

                   CLERK
         What's that?
                   JOKER
         It's just so hard to try and be
         happy all the time, y'know, when
         everything's going to shit all
         around you.
                   CLERK
             (taken aback; beat)
         Listen, I'm just an administrative
         assistant, like a clerk. I file
         paperwork, fill out forms. I don't
         really know what to tell you, but
         maybe you should see someone-- they
         have programs, like city services.
                   JOKER
             (backtracking)
         Yeah. They cut those. Anyway, I was
         just talking to talk.
The clerk just nods. Finally finds what he was looking for.

                   CLERK
             (surprised)
         Here it is,-- Fleck. Penny Fleck.
He pulls out an old file, bulging with yellowing records. Moves the box to the floor and sits down at his desk.

                   JOKER
             (saying it out loud for
              himself to hear)
         So she was a patient here.
The guy opens the file. Yellowing pages of her records--

                                                       78.

                   CLERK
             (nods, skim-reading)
         Uh-huh. Diagnosed by Dr. Benjamin                      
         Stoner... The patient suffers from                     
         delusional psychosis and                               
         narcissistic personality                               
         disorder... Found guilty of                            
         endangering the welfare of a child--                   
The clerk stops reading out loud, eyes going wide as he skims further ahead. Joker just looks at the guy, waiting to see what he's gonna say.

                   JOKER
         What?
                   CLERK                                        
         You said she's your mother?
Joker just nods.

                   CLERK
             (closes the file)
         I'm sorry, I can't. Like I said, I
         can't release this without the
         proper forms. I could get in
         trouble.
             (closes the file; beat)
         Besides, it's pretty bad.
CLOSE ON JOKER, he shakes his head and smiles to himself.

                   JOKER
         I can handle bad. I've been on a
         pretty bad run myself.
The clerk puts the file down on his desk--

                   CLERK
         I can't help you. If you want these
         records you have to get your mom to
         sign a patient disclosure form. I
         can have someone mail you one.
Joker just sits there, thinking it all over for a moment.

Then snatches the file off the clerk's desk--

The clerk grabs it as well.

They play tug-of-war with the file, it's awkward and goes on way too long. Finally, Joker shoves the guy hard and pulls the file away--

                                                             79.

    He takes off running out of the office with it. The clerk
    watches for a beat, but does nothing.

78 INT. HALLWAY, ARKHAM STATE HOSPITAL - MORNING 78

    Joker running down the hallway, files in his hands. Frantic.
    Unaware he is not being chased.
    Turns a corner and runs down another long hallway.
    Gets to a stairwell door and runs in.

79 INT. STAIRWELL, ARKHAM STATE HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS 79

    Bounding down the steps. He stops at a landing below. Looks        
    up, sees no one is chasing after him--                             
    ANGLE ON JOKER, catching his breath. He opens the file,
    flipping through the records, finds the page the clerk was
    reading. As he reads it over for himself, he HEARS his mother      
    being interviewed for her psychiatric assessment, over 30          
    years ago.                                                         
                        MOM (VO)                                       
              He's not adopted-- he's Thomas                           
              Wayne's son. I work for him, I told                      
              you, I clean his house. He's always                      
              smiling at me.

80 INT. EMERGENCY INTERVIEW ROOM, ARKHAM STATE HOSPITAL - DAY 80

    (FLASHBACK)                                                        
    Penny Fleck (late 20's) is sitting across the table from DR.       
    BENJAMIN STONER (50's), in a dreary small interview room,          
    windows covered with security screens. Penny takes a drag off      
    a cigarette, her face is beaten to shit, nose battered, lip        
    busted up.                                                         
    Dr. Stoner is going over Penny's thick file, the same file         
    Joker's holding in his hands.                                      
                        DR. STONER                                     
              We went over this, Penny. You                            
              adopted him. We have all the                             
              paperwork right here.                                    
    Penny doesn't say anything, just smiles like she's in on a         
    big secret. And exhales smoke.                                     
                                                          80.

Dr. Stoner keeps going through the file, pulls out black & white forensic photographs of three-year-old Joker's body--

                   DR. STONER                                    
         You also stood by as one of your                        
         boyfriends repeatedly abused your                       
         adopted son. And battered you.                          
Penny looks at Dr. Stoner like he's crazy.

                    MOM                                          
         He didn't do anything to me. Or to                      
         my boy. Can I go now, I don't like                      
         hospitals.                                              
Dr. Stoner lays out the photographs in front of Penny--

Penny keeps smoking her cigarette, glances down at the photos, we catch glimpses of various bruises on parts of Joker's body... A filthy crib... A rope tied to the radiator...

                                               CUT BACK TO:      
Joker looking over the same black & white photographs, still HEARS his mother--

                   MOM (V0)                                      
         I never heard him crying. Not once.                     
         He's always been such a happy                           
         little boy.                                             
                   DR. STONER (VO)                               
         Penny, your son was found tied to a                     
         radiator in your filthy apartment,                      
         malnourished, with multiple bruises                     
         across his body and severe trauma                       
         to his head.                                            
Joker looks up from the file when he hears/reads this, turns and looks at Penny's reaction-- HE'S NOW IN THE INTERVIEW ROOM WITH THEM, living what he's reading on the page.

He sees his mother lean forward in her chair, glaring at Dr. Stoner--

                   MOM                                           
         That's not true. My apartment                           
         wasn't filthy. I keep a clean                           
         house.                                                  
Joker just stares at his mother.

Dr. Stoner looks at Penny, not sure how to respond to that.

                                                              81.

                         DR. STONER                                   
                  (beat)                                              
              And what do you have to say about                       
              your son?                                               
    ANGLE ON PENNY, thinking it over, taking a drag off her           
    cigarette.                                                        
                        MOM                                           
              I'm just glad I got to know him.                        
    Joker just keeps staring at her as she exhales--                  
    JOKER BACK IN THE STAIRWELL LOOKS UP FROM THE FILE, looks         
    like maybe there's cigarette smoke drifting in front of his       
    face--

81 EXT. SCHOOL PLAYGROUND, STREET - AFTERNOON 81

    Joker walking fast toward the playground. Sees Sophie talking
    with some other moms, as GiGi and a few kids play on the
    monkey bars.
    Sophie walks toward him, still disturbed about last night--
                        SOPHIE
              What the hell was that? You can't
              just walk into my apartment like
              that.
    He is taken aback by her anger--
                        JOKER
              No, wait,-- Sophie, we can get
              through this, that's why I'm here.
                        SOPHIE
              What are you talking about? What do
              you think this is?
                        JOKER
              I don't know. I mean I've never
              been with a woman "like that," but,
              this feels like a beginning to me.
                         SOPHIE
              Arthur, I was just being nice to
              you. I felt sorry for you. I have a
              boyfriend.
                                                       82.

                   JOKER
         You what? What? What kind of woman
         are you? Who does that?
Some of the other mothers turn toward them--

                   SOPHIE
         You need to leave. I'm not having
         this conversation with you.
                   JOKER
             (shouts)
         Why not?
GiGi runs up to Sophie's side to see what's going on, to see if her mother's okay.

                   SOPHIE
             (turns to her daughter)
         Go back with your friends, honey.
         Mommy's having a grown up talk.
Before GiGi leaves Joker looks down at her--

                   JOKER
         No. Don't listen to her GiGi, you
         need to hear this. Your mother's a
         bad person. She's a whore, she's
         seeing two men at once. You can't
         trust her,-- She'll break your
         fucking heart.
Joker turns to go, behind him GiGi starts to cry. He's close to tears himself.

Sophie takes off after him, and reaches out and grabs him-- Joker spins quickly around to face her, looks like he might even hit her--

                   JOKER
         How come nothing ever comes easy
         for me?
And Sophie slaps him hard across the face-- Then turns and walks away.

CLOSE ON JOKER, he begins to laugh--

82 INT. MOM'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 82

    Joker manically pacing around the living room, banging the         
    side of his head with his hand, muttering to himself, almost       
    like he's having a conversation with himself, taking part in       
    some story in his head, in the background the 11:00 News is        
    playing on the television.                                         
    Footage of a protest in front of Wayne Tower... Protesters in
    "Joker" clown masks... Hear the NEWS ANCHOR's bombastic voice
    over, "The anger and resentment that's been building up for
    weeks now, seems close to exploding. Protestors today, many
    dressed as clowns, took to the streets in front of Wayne
    Tower in one of many planned demonstrations."
    Joker stops when he hears this, turns to the flickering
    screen--
    ANGLE ON TELEVISION, protesters in the middle of a massive
    crowd outside a Wayne Tower.
                        "CLOWN" PROTESTER #1 (ON TV)

              City Hall next Thursday. We're
              gonna--
    Joker sits down on the couch eyes, leaning forward to make
    sure he's seeing what he's seeing--

    Sun peeking through the windows. PHONE RINGING. Joker opening
    his eyes.
    His orange cat is sitting on his chest, staring at him.
    Joker finally got some sleep. He lies there for a beat. Phone
    still ringing, until the machine picks up the call.

         up on the show recently and we've                      
         gotten an amazing--                                    
Joker picks up the phone--

         Yes.                                                   
Joker looks down at the cat purring at his feet, and kicks it away.

         Hi Arthur. Well, as I was saying--                     
         we've gotten a lot of calls about                      
         your clip, amazing responses. And,                     
         Murray asked if I would reach out                      
         to see if you would come on as his                     
         guest. Can we set up a day?                            
PUSH IN ON JOKER'S FACE, as it sinks in.

                   JOKER

         Murray wants me to come on the                         
         show?                                                  
                   SHOW BOOKER (OVER PHONE)                     
         Yes. Isn't that great? He'd love to                    
         talk to you, maybe do some of your                     
         act. Does that sound good to you?

    Hold.                                                              

84 INT. CITY HOSPITAL, HOSPITAL ROOM (SHARED) - MORNING 84

    JOKER WALKS INTO HIS MOTHER'S SHARED HOSPITAL ROOM, passing
    an elderly wheezing woman in the bed closest to the door.
    Sees his mom in her bed by the window.
    He pulls the blue curtain separating the beds, giving him and
    his mother some privacy. Sits down on the edge of her bed.
    She smiles when she sees him. Still fairly incapacitated.
    He leans down close to her. Speaks softly, but filled with
    rage--
                        JOKER
              Ma, remember how you used to tell
              me that God gave me this laugh for
              a reason. That I had a purpose. To
              bring laughter and joy into this
              fucked up world,--
    She looks at him confused.                                         
                        JOKER
              HA! It wasn't God, it was you or,                        
              or one of your boyfriends,-- how                         
              could you let that happen? What
              kind of woman are you? What kind of
              mother are you?
    She looks away.
                        JOKER
              What's my real name?
    Her whole body is shaking, overwhelmed with emotion.
                        JOKER
              C'mon, Ma, I know I was adopted.
              What's my name? Who am I really?
    She looks back him, struggles to speak--
                           MOM
              H-h-happ--
                        JOKER
                  (interrupting, snaps at
                   her)
                        (MORE)
                                                              86.
                        JOKER (CONT'D)
              Happy?! I'm not happy. I haven't
              been happy for one minute of my
              entire fucking life.
    He reaches behind her, grabs one of her pillows--
                        JOKER
              But you know what's funny? You know
              what really makes me laugh?
    Leans down closer, face-to-face with her--
                        JOKER
              I used to think my life was nothing
              but a tragedy, but now, now I
              realize it's all just a fucking                          
              comedy.

85 INT. BLUE CURTAIN, HOSPITAL ROOM (SHARED) - CONTINUOUS 85

    Other side of the blue divider curtain. We see Joker's feet
    shifting a little.
    SLOWLY WE PULL OUT, backing out of the room. Leaving behind
    whatever Joker's doing to his mother on the other side of the
    curtain. And we HEAR applause...                                   

86 INT. MOM'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 86

    JOKER'S STUDYING VHS TAPES OF "MURRAY FRANKLIN LIVE!", studio      
    audience applauding Murray... He jots down notes in his worn       
    notebook... Watches the guests come out... how they cross the      
    stage... how they greet Murray... how they sit down... if          
    they cross their legs or not... studying how he should act,        
    how to be a person like other people.                              
    His cat sits on top of the TV watching him the whole time,         
    never taking her eyes off him.
                                                        JUMP CUT:
    Practicing. Joker walks across the living room like he's on
    the show, smiling, waving to the "audience"... He mimes
    shaking Murray's hand... Mimes unbuttoning his jacket and
    sits down. He smiles and pulls out his worn notebook from his      
    pocket--                                                           
                        JOKER                                          
              You wanna hear a joke, Murray?                           
    He "waits" for Murray to answer. Then Joker nods okay and          
    opens his notebook--                                               
                                                            87.

                  (reading)                                            
              Knock-knock.                                             
    His cat still watching him, now at his feet. Joker crosses
    and uncrosses his legs... Looks uncomfortable.
    He glances down at his cat. It's as if he can hear the cat
    talking to him.
                        JOKER
                  (nods; frustrated)
              Yeah, I don't know if I should
              cross or uncross 'em. Both feel
              completely unnatural.
    Joker gets up off the couch and walks back across the living       
    room. Waves to the "audience"... Mimes shaking Murray's
    hand... Mimes unbuttoning his coat and sits down... Crosses
    his legs.
                        JOKER
              Thanks for having me on, Murray. I                       
              can't tell you how much this means                       
              to me, it's been a life long dream.                      
              I have a joke for you--                                  
    Joker stands back up.
    Looks down at the cat again.
                        JOKER
              You're right. You're right,
              uncrossed is better.
    Joker sits back down... Doesn't cross his legs this time.
                                                       CUT TO:

87 EXT. POTTER'S FIELD CEMETERY - DUSK 87

    WIDE SHOT, a lone figure in a vast sea of mass graves, grey        
    headstones. This is where they bury the poor and the
    unclaimed dead.
    Joker stands by his mother's grave. His head bowed, face in
    his hands, his body convulsing. He's dressed in an ill-
    fitting faded rust colored suit, almost shiny from all the
    wear. Behind him in the distance, the TWO DETECTIVES stand by
    their parked car on the cemetery roadway. Sun dying in the
    sky.
                                                            88.

    CLOSE ON JOKER'S FACE BURIED IN HIS HANDS, see he's laughing--
    impossible to tell if he's laughing because of his condition
    or laughing for real.

88 EXT. ROADWAY, POTTER'S FIELD CEMETERY - DUSK 88

    Joker walking away from his mother's grave, goes to the two
    detectives -- GARRITY and BURKE -- waiting for him by their
    unmarked car. His face is still red, tears in his eyes from
    laughing.
                        JOKER
                  (wiping his eyes;
                   restrained anger)
              You shouldn't be here. It's not
              right.
                        DET. GARRITY
              We just came to pay our respects.
              Sorry about your mother.
                        DET. BURKE
              Yeah, it's too bad.
    Joker just stares at the two detectives.
    Awkward beat.
                        DET. BURKE
              Where is everybody?
                        JOKER
              It's always been just me and her.
    Joker pauses for a moment, then starts to walk away.
                        DET. BURKE
                  (calls out)
              We saw you on Murray Franklin.
    Joker turns back to them.
                        JOKER
              You saw that?
                        DET. GARRITY
              Yeah. Heard you were on, so we got
              a videotape.
                        DET. BURKE
              I just couldn't tell if you were
              actually trying to be funny or not.
                                                            89.

                        JOKER
              Yeah, well I guess you didn't get
              the joke.
                        DET. GARRITY
              Listen, we need to clear a few
              things up, we spoke to the hospital
              administrator--
                        JOKER
                  (interrupting)
              Which hospital?
                        DET. BURKE
              The Children's Hospital.
                  (reminding)
              The night you were fired. He said
              it didn't look like a prop gun, it
              was heavy, like a real one. We have
              some more questions for you.
                        JOKER
              I just buried my mother.
    The detectives share a look. Garrity pulls out a card. Hands
    it to Joker.
                        DET. GARRITY
              We can do it tomorrow. But you need
              to come down to the precinct--
              first thing in the morning.
                         JOKER
                  (looks down, reading the
                   card)
              Right. Thanks for coming.
                           DET. BURKE
              Of course.
    Joker looks back up.
                        JOKER
              That was a joke.
    We hear applause followed by the familiar opening riff to
    ELTON JOHN'S "Bennie & the Jets".

89 INT. MOM'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NEXT AFTERNOON 89

    JOKER'S LEANING OVER THE BATHROOM SINK, water running. He's
    wearing rust colored pants and a white "beater" T-shirt.
                                                               90.

    A "Joker" clown mask hangs off the dirty mirror by its
    elastic band. "Bennie & the Jets" blaring from a transistor
    radio turned all the way up.
    Joker lifts his head up. He's dyed his hair green like his
    old "Mr. Jingles" clown wig-- but he's missed spots. Some of
    his hair is still its original color, sticking out all helter-
    skelter.
                                                     JUMP CUT:
    Now he's smearing white grease-paint all over his face.
    He's dancing along to the music, gyrating and thrusting his
    hips to the beat, as he glances at the mask hanging from the
    mirror, trying to copy how it looks... A copy of a copy of
    himself.
    He barely hears someone banging on the front door over the
    loud music--
    Doesn't answer. Joker just keeps putting on his make-up,
    dancing provocatively to the music.
    More banging on the front door.
    Joker casually opens the medicine cabinet. Finds some old
    rusty scissors and turns the radio off--

90 INT. FRONT DOOR, MOM'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON 90

    Joker unlocks the locks, keeping the security chain latched,       
    and cracks open the door,-- Sees Randall. Looks down, and          
    sees Gary next to him. Undoes the chain and opens the door         
    for them--                                                         
    Randall and Gary get a look at Joker's face, his dyed green        
    hair still wet, streaking white grease-paint smeared over          
    part of his face--                                                 
                         GARY
                  (re: his look)
              Hey Arthur, how's it going? You get
              a new gig?
    Joker shakes his head no, steps aside so they can come in,         
    palming the scissors in his hand--
                        RANDALL
              You must be goin' down to that
              rally at City Hall. Right? I hear
              it's gonna be nuts.
                                                         91.

                   JOKER
         Is that today?
Randall looks at him and laughs--

                   RANDALL
         Yeah. What's with the clown-face
         then?
Joker shuts the door behind them. Locks the chain-lock.

                   JOKER
         My mom died.
                   RANDALL                                      
             (nodding)                                          
         Yeah we heard. That's why we're                        
         here. Figured you might wanna go                       
         out, get a drink or something?                         
Joker doesn't answer.

Awkward beat.

                   GARY                                         
         We don't wanna bother you. Randall                     
         just thought we should come and pay                    
         our respects.                                          
                   RANDALL                                      
         Yeah, we're family. We gotta stick                     
         together.                                              
Joker stares at Randall.

                    JOKER                                       
             (beat)                                             
         It's not a good time. I'm in the                       
         middle of something here.                              
                   GARY                                         
         Of course. No problem. Another                         
         time.                                                  
Gary turns to go. Randall pauses for a moment, has something else to say before he leaves--

                   RANDALL                                      
         Yeah. Another time, then. Oh hey,--                    
         one other thing--                                      
He takes a step closer to Joker--

                                                        92.

                   RANDALL                                      
         Listen, the cops have been poking                      
         around the shop, they're talking to                    
         all the clowns about those subway                      
         murders and--                                          
                   GARY                                         
             (interrupting)                                     
         They didn't talk to me.                                
                    RANDALL                                     
             (snaps at Gary)                                    
         That's because the suspect was a                       
         regular-sized person. If it was a                      
         fucking midget you'd be in jail                        
         right now.                                             
             (turns back to Joker)                              
         Anyway, Hoyt said they were looking                    
         for me, and, and I just wanna see                      
         what you said. You know, make sure                     
         our stories line up, bein' that                        
         you're my boy and--                                    
AND JOKER STABS THE SCISSORS AS DEEP AS HE CAN into Randall's neck. Blood spurts. Randall screams. Gary stumbles back in shock--

                    GARY
             (screaming)
         What the fuck what the fuck WHAT
         THE FUCK--
Joker pulls them out and jams them into Randall's eye before he can react. The sound is sickening. Gary's screaming in the background--

Randall blindly fights back, screaming in pain, flailing his arms, his own blood blinding him--

Joker grabs Randall by the head -- all of his pent up rage and frustration pouring out of him -- AND SLAMS HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WALL.

AGAIN. And AGAIN. And AGAIN.

Joker lets go of Randall's head, and Randall drops to the ground. Joker leans back against the wall, out of breath, kind of slides down the wall to the floor--

Sees Gary huddled in the corner, trembling with fear--

                                                               93.

                        JOKER
                  (catching his breath)
              I'm gonna be on TV tonight. Can you
              believe it?
    Gary doesn't answer. Doesn't move--
                        JOKER
              It's okay, Gary. You can go.
    Gary backs away toward the door. Joker sits there for a
    moment, breathing heavy, wipes Randall's blood off his face--
                          GARY (OS)
              Hey, Art?
    Joker turns, sees Gary at the front door. He points up high
    to the chain-lock. He can't reach it.
    Joker just shakes his head to himself and gets up to unlock
    the door.
    He walks past Gary who's still trembling almost too afraid to
    look up at him. Joker leans over him and undoes the chain,
    opens the door. Gary bolts, running down the hallway as fast
    as he can--
                                                         CUT TO:

91 INT. MOM'S BEDROOM, APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON 91

    (Over the following, we don't see Joker's face. We don't
    reveal his finished "look" just yet.)
    CLOSE PICKING UP HIS NOTEBOOK, fanning through the pages--         
    Pausing at the BLACK & WHITE RIPPED PHOTO OF BRUCE WAYNE for
    a moment. Continues, stopping at the same entry from the
    opening scene--
    CLOSE ON WORDS, "I just hope my death make more sense than my
    life."

92 INT. LIVING ROOM, MOM'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON 92

    CLOSE ON TAKING RANDALL'S WALLET OUT OF HIS BLOOD SOAKED           
    PANTS, pocketing all the cash.
    CLOSE ON BUTT OF A GUN STICKING OUT OF RANDALL'S WAISTBAND,        
    glimpse Joker's hand reaching for it--                             
                                                            94.

93 INT. KITCHEN, MOM'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON 93

    JOKER'S P.O.V. FINISHING WRITING A NOTE, "On Murray Franklin      
    Tonight -- Please Watch!"                                         
    CLOSE ON STUFFING THE NOTE AND ALL OF RANDALL'S MONEY into an     
    envelope--                                                        
    TURNING ENVELOPE OVER, WRITING "SOPHIE" on the front.             

94 INT. LIVING ROOM WINDOW, MOM'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON 94

    CLOSE ON THE ORANGE CAT AT THE WINDOW, and maybe if we're
    looking close enough we notice something strange... the cat
    has no reflection.
    ANGLE OVER JOKER'S SHOULDER OPENING THE WINDOW, shooing the       
    cat out onto the fire escape, out into the dying day--            
                        JOKER (OS)
              Go on. Go. You're free.                                 
    CLOSE ON THE CAT LOOKING BACK AT JOKER FOR A LONG MOMENT,
    before scampering off out into the world, leaving him behind
    for good.
    As he closes the window we almost catch Joker's reflection in
    the glass--

95 INT. HALLWAY, APARTMENT BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON 95

    FOLLOWING BEHIND JOKER, walking down the hallway as if in
    slow motion, heading for Sophie's apartment. His dyed green
    hair now slicked back.
    He's wearing the ill-fitting rust colored suit he wore to his
    mother's funeral.
    STILL FROM BEHIND, he lays the envelope in front of Sophie's      
    door, then pulls something else out of his pocket -- his body     
    obscuring what it is -- puts it down by her door and leaves.      
    As he walks away down the hallway, we see what else Joker         
    left behind--                                                     
    HIS WAND OF FLOWERS, at Sophie's door.                            
    Hold.                                                             
                                                              95.

96 INT. ELEVATOR, HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON 96

    FROM BEHIND JOKER STEPPING ONTO THE ELEVATOR, TURNING TO FACE      
    US AS THE DOOR STARTS TO CLOSE, FINALLY REVEALING HIS LOOK--       
    Green hair slicked back like one of the Wall Street assholes       
    he killed... White grease paint smeared over his face... red       
    nose painted on... dark blue peaks over and under his eyes...      
    his mother's red lipstick crudely outlining his broken             
    smile... Under the harsh flickering fluorescent lights, he         
    looks like an insane version of his mask.                          
    The door closes on his new face. Ding.                             

97 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON 97

    Joker steps out of his building into the setting sun, just as      
    Garrity and Burke are getting out of their unmarked Ford LTD       
    Crown Vic--                                                        
                        DET. GARRITY                                   
              Hey Arthur, where you going?                             
                        DET. BURKE                                     
              Yeah, thought you were coming down                       
              to the station this morning.                             
    And Joker takes off running--
    Garrity gives chase on foot as Burke hurries back into the
    car--                                                              

98 EXT. 174TH STREET, TWO LANES - CONTINUOUS 98

    Joker darts out from his block into the avenue, sprints
    across the busy, two-lane street without looking--
    Running right in front of an oncoming YELLOW CAB on the far
    side of the street--
    BAM!
    The cab hits him and Joker goes crashing into the windshield.
    Bounces up and over the car. Landing hard on the pavement--
    The car directly behind the cab skids to a stop just before
    running over Joker's face. Swerving into the other lane and
    CRASHING INTO an oncoming truck.
    Cars on both sides of the street skidding trying to stop--
    Crashing. It's chaos.
                                                               96.

     Joker pops back up from getting hit. He's in pain. But not
     dead.
     Garrity has drawn his service revolver as he makes his way
     through the pile up. And Burke, now blocked because of the
     crash has jumped out of his car--
     Joker takes off running, limping down the street toward an
     entrance for the elevated train--

99 EXT. ELEVATED TRAIN STATION, STEPS - CONTINUOUS 99

     Joker hustling up the stairs, dripping sweat, his white
     grease-paint running down his face. He gets to the top of the
     stairs, looks back and catches a glimpse of Garrity and Burke
     at the bottom--

100 EXT. PLATFORM, ELEVATED TRAIN STATION - CONTINUOUS 100

     Joker makes his way down the crowded platform, the passengers
     starting to file on a waiting Lexington Ave/Pelham Express
     Train heading downtown. The train's packed with protesters
     heading to the rally at City Hall. Many carrying signs...
     most of them in "Joker" masks... a few painted up to look
     like the "Joker" mask. Joker fits in with all of them.             
     He looks through the crowd of clowns and sees the two cops
     getting to the top of the stairs, looking up and down the
     platform for him. Pulling out their badges on chains from
     around their necks. Identifying themselves as cops.
     Joker's willing the doors to close. But they don't.
     The two detectives run onto the train just as the doors are
     finally closing--

101 INT. LEXINGTON AVE/PELHAM EXPRESS (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS 101

     Joker moves through the loud train pushing through the rowdy
     protesters-- Into the next car, all of them packed.                
     AS THE TRAIN GOES UNDERGROUND, the lights flicker on and off--  
     car GOING BLACK FOR A FEW SECONDS as the train turns and dips  
     and speeds down the tracks.                                     
     Joker glances back at Burke and Garrity pulling out their          
     badges on chains around their necks. Smith & Wesson service        
     revolvers by their sides. Shouting at the crowd, identifying       
     themselves as cops.                                                
                                                          97.

Joker hears some on the train shouting back in anger at the police, keeps moving... past clown-faced protestors carrying signs, "RESIST"... "AM I A CLOWN?"... "SAVE A CITY, KILL A YUPPIE"...

The two cops push through the car, scanning all the "clown" faces... So many look like Joker. They just shove protesters out of the way, shouting at them all the while. A few more voices rising up in protest--

Joker feels Burke and Garrity behind him getting closer. In the flickering light sees a DRUNK GUY (20's) wearing a 'Joker' mask and pulls it right off his face--

The drunk guy turns ready to fight.

He throws a punch at Joker, and Joker steps out of the way--

The guy pummels someone else--

A FIGHT BREAKS OUT, spilling down the car.

Joker slips the clown mask over his clown face--

AND JUST STANDS THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CHAOS, at home with the chaos all around him--

Garrity and Burke spot Joker's rust colored suit in the middle of the unruly mob--

Burke pulls his gun--

                   BURKE                                         
             (shouting)                                          
         EVERYBODY DOWN, GOTHAM PD!                              
The crowd doesn't drop to the ground. They just keep fighting with each other--

Burke sees Joker just standing there. Keeps yelling for the crowd to get down, get down, but they don't listen to him--

He starts shoving protestors down, out of the way-- and

AND THEN THE MOB TURNS ON HIM AND GARRITY, starts closing in around them--

Garrity and Burke are pointing their guns at the crowd, yelling panicked for them to back off, back off, and one idiot reaches for Garrity's gun--

Bang.

                                                               98.

     Burke fires into the crowd, as the train pulls into the           
     station--                                                         
     A protestor falls dead. The other clowns on the train go          
     crazy, starting to riot. Glimpse Joker walking away calmly        
     out of the chaos. Taking off the mask and dropping it at his      
     side as he steps off the train, disappearing onto the crowded     
     platform.                                                         
                                                          CUT TO:      

102 EXT. WGCTV STUDIOS, FRANKLIN THEATER - MIDTOWN - EVENING 102

     An excited line of ticket holders waiting to get in to "Live
     with Murray Franklin!" The poster marquee box near the door
     reads: "TONIGHT'S GUESTS. Lance Reynolds. Dr. Sally Friedman.
     And Special Guest."
     They swing open the doors and start to let the audience
     inside...

103 EXT. BACKSTAGE DOOR, FRANKLIN THEATER - SIDE STREET - EVENING

                                                              103      
     Random fans and autograph hounds hanging out by the backstage
     door, waiting for the night's guests to arrive...

104 INT. STUDIO 4B, STAGE - FRANKLIN THEATER - EVENING 104

     Studio audience filing into the studio, being seated in the
     wide bleachers along one wall. Three TV monitors hang from
     the ceiling, facing the audience. Three studio cameras on the
     floor, black cables strewn everywhere.
     The set for "LIVE WITH MURRAY FRANKLIN!" is dark... but we
     can still make out his desk... guest chairs... Don Ellis and
     his Jazz Orchestra's band stand... big blue curtain.

105 INT. HALLWAY, FRANKLIN THEATER - EVENING 105

     The host of the show, MURRAY FRANKLIN (60's), usually quick
     with a bemused grin but right now in a sour mood, walks fast
     down the hall toward the drab dressing rooms with his old-
     school producer, GENE UFLAND (60's), who's holding the show's
     rundown rolled up in his hand.
                          GENE UFLAND
               --You gotta see this nut for
               yourself, Murray. I don't think we
               can put him on. With the rioting                        
               out there.                                              
                                                                99.

                         MURRAY FRANKLIN
                   (annoyed)
               Jesus, Gene, I don't have time for
               this. Cindy's been breaking my
               balls all day.
                         GENE UFLAND
               She's still mad at you about that
               thing?
                          MURRAY FRANKLIN
               Three marriages, you'd think I'da
               fuckin' learned something.
                   (then)
               What do I gotta see? I already know
               he's a nut. That's why we're
               putting him on, it's a goof.
     A young BLONDE INTERN walks by in the opposite direction. She
     nervously smiles to them and keeps walking. Both men turn and
     check out her ass. Murray winks at Gene.
                         GENE UFLAND
                   (just shakes his head, and
                    smiles)
               I'm telling you, you gotta see him,
               Murray. I think it's too risky, the
               show's too big. It's worth too much
               to blow it on this,-- this freak.

106 INT. DRESSING ROOM, FRANKLIN THEATER - CONTINUOUS 106

     Joker's sitting on a small couch in the cramped dressing
     room, watching the local news on a TV that's mounted up on
     the wall, live shots from the subway station where Burke shot      
     the protestor, footage of the City Hall rally, clashes with        
     police.                                                            
     He's cleaned himself up as best he could... white grease-
     paint smeared more evenly over his face, green dyed hair
     slicked back in place. Red lips redone.
     Murray and his producer Gene open the dressing room door
     without knocking--
     Joker gets up off the couch and goes to shake Murray's hand.
     Murray pauses when he sees Joker's face.
                         JOKER
                   (shakes Murray's hand;
                    effusive)
               Murray, I can't believe this is
               real, that I'm really here.
                                                      100.

                   GENE UFLAND
         It's Mr. Franklin kid, show some
         respect.
                   MURRAY FRANKLIN
         Oh shut up, Gene.
             (to Joker)
         Murray is fine. I prefer it in
         fact. Thanks for coming on the
         show.
                   JOKER
         Are you kidding? Thank you for the
         opportunity. I've been watching you
         forever. My mother never missed a
         show.
Murray nods not listening, he's heard this before.

                   MURRAY FRANKLIN
         So what's with the face? Are you
         part of the protests?
                   JOKER
         No, I don't believe in any of that.
         I don't believe in anything. I just
         thought it would be good for my
         act.
                   GENE UFLAND                                  
             (upset)                                            
         Your act? Didn't you hear that a                       
         kid got killed on the subway and                       
         two cops who were almost beat to                       
         death? You didn't hear about the                       
         dozens of protestors and police                        
         injured in the riots?                                  
Joker looks like he's about to bust out laughing. All of that news is playing out on the TV above their heads. He takes a deep breath. Swallows the laugh.

Beat.

                   JOKER
         No. I hadn't heard.
Gene and Murray share a look.

                   GENE UFLAND
         --the audience is gonna go crazy if
         you put him on. It was okay maybe
         for a bit, but not a whole segment.
                                                      101.

Murray thinks about it for a beat.

                    MURRAY FRANKLIN
         I like it. It's timely. It's edgy.
         It's, it's dangerous. The best
         comedy is all those things put
         together.
             (done)
         We're gonna go with it.
Gene rubs his temples, he doesn't like this, but Murray is the boss.

                   JOKER
         Thank you Murray.
                   MURRAY FRANKLIN
             (flashes his bemused
              smile; condescending)
         Couple rules though,-- No cussing,
         no off-color material, we do a
         clean show, okay? You'll be on
         after Dr. Sally. Someone will come
         and get you. Good?
Joker nods good. Smiles back at Murray.

Murray and Gene turn to go, exchanging smirks with each other as they walk out, making light of Joker who we see behind them still standing there.

                   JOKER
         Hey Murray,-- one small thing? When
         you bring me out, can you introduce
         me as "The Joker"?
Murray and Gene look back at him

                    GENE UFLAND
         What? You don't want to use your
         real name?
                   JOKER
         Honestly, I don't even know what my
         real name is.
Joker smiles, the guys can't tell if he's kidding or not.

                   JOKER
         Besides, that's what you called me
         on the show, Murray. A joker.
         Remember?
                                                             102.

                         MURRAY FRANKLIN
                   (to Gene; trying not to
                    crack up)
               Did I?
                         GENE UFLAND
               I have no idea.
                         MURRAY FRANKLIN
                   (turns back to Joker)
               Well, if you say so, kid. Joker it
               is.
     Murray starts to laugh at Joker as he closes the dressing
     room door, shutting it right in his face.
                                                          CUT TO:

107 INT. BACKSTAGE, BEHIND CURTAIN - STUDIO 4B - NIGHT 107

     JOKER'S BACKSTAGE AT THE EDGE OF THE BLUE CURTAIN, trying to
     watch the show through a slim gap. Behind him there's a
     monitor on a cart playing the live feed.
     He moves the curtain aside to get a better look-- Glimpses
     Murray laughing, finishing up talking to noted sex therapist
     DR. SALLY FRIEDMAN (60's).
                         MURRAY FRANKLIN
                   (to Dr. Sally)
               You gotta see our next guest for
               yourself. Will you stick around?
               Maybe you can help, I'm pretty sure
               he could use a doctor.
     The audience laughs.
                         DR. SALLY FRIEDMAN
               Oh. Does he have sexual problems?
                         MURRAY FRANKLIN
               He looks like he's got a lot of
               problems.
     Another big laugh.
                         MURRAY FRANKLIN
                   (turns, looks into camera)
               It's been a crazy few days here in
               Gotham, and, I think maybe things
               are about to get crazy around here
               too. Don't go anywhere folks. We'll
               be right back.
                                                            103.

     APPLAUSE SIGN LIGHTS UP. Everyone claps. Joker keeps watching      
     Murray through the slim gap at the end of the curtain. Hears
     the floor director shout, "And we're out. Back in three."          
     Joker adjusts the waist of his pants under his jacket. Takes       
     a deep breath.                                                     

108 INT. DIRECTOR'S BOOTH, STUDIO 4B - NIGHT 108

     Perched one story above the studio. There's a long console
     where the DIRECTOR sits in front of a gooseneck microphone,
     looking over a double-bank of monitors.
     Sitting next to him are the ASSOCIATE PRODUCER who times the
     show, and the TECHNICAL DIRECTOR who operates the board. The
     monitor showing the live feed is playing a commercial.
                         ASSOCIATE PRODUCER
               Back in 30 seconds.
                         DIRECTOR
               Okay, cue the clip. We'll come to
               it straight out of break.
                         ASSOCIATE PRODUCER
               Five... Four... Three...
                         DIRECTOR
               Roll clip. Put up the show graphic.
     ON THE SHOW MONITOR, video of Joker's original stand-up
     performance comes up with the show's graphic in the lower
     right of the screen.

109 INT. TALK SHOW SET, STAGE - STUDIO 4B - CONTINUOUS 109

     ON THE SET, Murray watches the clip on the monitor above his
     desk, can't help but laugh. Sees the FLOOR DIRECTOR counting
     him down silently with her fingers... Three... Two... points
     to Camera One.
                         MURRAY FRANKLIN
                   (looking into camera)
               O-kay, you may have seen that clip
               of our next guest when we first
               played it two weeks ago. Now before
               he comes out, I just want to say
               that we're all heartbroken here and
               sensitive to what's going on in the
               city tonight. But, this is how he
               wanted to come on the show. So let
               me introduce-- The Joker.
                                                         104.

BEHIND THE BLUE CURTAIN, Joker gathers himself, ready for his moment. Doesn't hear his introduction or see a STAGEHAND pull open the curtain for him to go out--

ON SET, THE CURTAIN'S OPEN, Don Ellis and his Jazz Orchestra are playing Joker on. He doesn't come out. Murray looks over to the empty space in the curtain.

The audience laughs.

BEHIND THE CURTAIN, Joker sees the stagehand motioning for him to go out on stage. Joker starts out, pausing when he takes a step into the bright lights. The stagehand doesn't see him stop, and drops the curtain back on Joker before the audience can really see his face--

Tangling Joker up in the curtain.

The audience keeps laughing thinking it's part of his act. The band keeps playing him on. Joker untangles himself from the curtain and the audience gets a good look at him.

Some continue laughing. A few boo. Most don't know what to make of him.

Joker walks across the stage, forgetting to wave like he practiced. He trips over the riser surrounding the set when he goes to shake Murray's hand. Almost falls on him.

Murray tries not to crack up. The audience laughs. Thinks it's part of Joker's act.

Joker reaches out to hug Dr. Sally as she goes in for a handshake. Another awkward moment. More laughs.

Joker finally sits down next to Murray. Crosses and uncrosses his legs. Can't get comfortable.

                   MURRAY FRANKLIN
         So, ahhh, thanks for coming on the
         show. But I gotta tell ya, with
         what happened at City Hall today,
         I'm sure many of our viewers here
         in the studio, and at home, might
         find this look of yours in poor
         taste.
Joker's not listening to Murray. He's mesmerized by all the lights shining on him... all the eyes on him... he doesn't answer Murray.

Nervous laughter from the audience.

                                                            105.

                          MURRAY FRANKLIN
                   (tries again)
               Can you tell us why you're dressed
               like this?
     AND JOKER STARTS TO LAUGH. Not embarrassed of it anymore. He
     goes with it. Giving in to it, enjoying the laughter.
                         MURRAY FRANKLIN
                   (can't help but smile at
                    Joker's laughing)
               Okay. But I'm not sure how any of
               this is funny. A lot of those
               protesters are going with this
               look. City seems to be full of
               clowns these days.
                         JOKER
                   (just nods, still
                    laughing)
               Yeah. Isn't it great?
     Joker just keeps cracking up. Audience still isn't sure what
     to make of him. There's some awkward laughter.

110 INT. DIRECTOR'S BOOTH, STUDIO 4B - CONTINUOUS 110

     Nobody's laughing in the booth.
                         TECHNICAL DIRECTOR
                   (looks to the director)
               This guy's got nothing.
                          DIRECTOR
                   (hits the producer's talk
                     button; into the mic)
               Gene, what the hell? You wanna kill
               this?

111 INT. TALK SHOW SET, STAGE - CONTINUOUS 111

     Murray glances over at his producer Gene Ufland, who's
     sitting off-camera on a director's chair by a monitor. Gene
     shrugs at him.
                         MURRAY FRANKLIN
                   (smiles; trying to save
                    the interview)
               So when we talked earlier, you
               mentioned that you aren't
               political. That this look isn't a
               political statement.
                                                         106.

                   JOKER
             (between laughs)
         That's right. I'm not political,
         Murray. I'm, I'm, I'm just trying
         to make people laugh.
                   MURRAY FRANKLIN
             (beat; smiles)
         How's that goin' for ya? Have you
         been working on any new material?
         Do you want to tell us a joke?
The audience claps, egging Joker on to tell a joke.

Joker looks over at Murray -- his laughing fit finally subsiding -- and reaches into his jacket pocket and--

Pulls out his worn notebook, catching his breath. Looks through it to find a new joke.

                   MURRAY FRANKLIN
         You brought a joke book?
The audience laughs. Joker smiles, opens the page to Bruce Wayne's photo, pauses for a moment then turns the page. Finds a joke--

                   JOKER
             (reading)
         Okay. Here's one. Knock knock.
                   MURRAY FRANKLIN
         Oh god, a knock-knock joke? And you
         need to read it?
                   JOKER
             (nods, reads it again)
         I want to get it right. Knock
         knock.
Murray makes a face like, "Okay, I'll go along with this."

                   MURRAY FRANKLIN
         Who's there?
                    JOKER
             (looks up from his
              notebook)
         It's the police, ma'am. Your son
         has been hit by a drunk driver.
         He's dead.
Beat.

                                                            107.

112 INT. DIRECTOR'S BOOTH, STUDIO 4B - CONTINUOUS 112

     The associate producer tries not to laugh, but she can't help
     it. The director looks over at her like she's lost her mind.
                         DIRECTOR
                   (shakes his head)
               Okay, ready Camera Two. Take Two.
               Ready Three. Three.
     ON THE MONITORS, some of the audience cracks up. Joker smiles
     at the response. Murray Franklin shakes his head, smirking at
     the joke despite himself.
                         MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON MONITORS)
               So, Arthur, you told me backstage
               that your--
     Joker leans over interrupting Murray, whispers something to
     him.

113 INT. TALK SHOW SET, STAGE - STUDIO 4B - CONTINUOUS 113

     Murray nods as Joker whispers.
                         MURRAY FRANKLIN
                   (bemused smile;
                    patronizing)
               Right. Sorry. I mean Joker-- you
               told me backstage that your
               mother's a big fan of the show,
               that she never misses it.
     Joker puts the notebook back in his pocket. Crosses his legs,
     starting to get a bit more comfortable.
                         JOKER
               That's right, Murray. But she's
               dead now.
     The audience laughs.
                         MURRAY FRANKLIN
                   (goes along with the
                    "joke")
               Hold on. Your mother's dead?
                         JOKER
               Yeah. She is.
     Murray's not sure if this is part of his act.
                                                      108.

                   MURRAY FRANKLIN
         Okay. What about your father? Does
         he watch the show?
Laughter from the crowd.

                    JOKER
         I don't know who my father is,
         Murray. Turns out I was adopted and
         sexually assaulted by my mother's
         boyfriend.
A few in the audience groan. A couple even laugh. Still think it's just Joker's edgy, off-kilter sense of humor.

Don Ellis plays "wha-wha-wha-whuuuuh" on his trumpet from the band stand.

                   DR. SALLY FRIEDMAN
         Ahhhh! No, no,-- You can not joke
         about that.
                    MURRAY FRANKLIN
             (shakes his head;
               irritated)
         Yeah, that's not funny, that's not
         the kind of humor we do on this
         show.
Murray glances over at Gene in the wings. He gives him the "wrap it up" sign.

                    JOKER
             (just keeps going, on a
              roll)
         Sorry. It's been a rough few
         months, Murray. I mean, after my
         mother died, the police came to
         question me at her funeral. Who
         does that?
                   MURRAY FRANKLIN
             (too easy)
         Oh really? Were you a suspect?
The audience laughs.

                   JOKER
         Very funny, Murray. No, they came
         because I killed those three Wall
         Street guys.
Beat.

                                                            109.

     Studio audience can't tell if he's joking or not. Murray
     can't either.
                          MURRAY FRANKLIN
                   (looks at him confused)
               Okay. I'm waiting for the
               punchline.
                         JOKER
               There is no punchline. It's not a
               joke.

114 INT. DIRECTOR'S BOOTH, STUDIO 4B - CONTINUOUS 114

     The director stares at the monitor.
                         DIRECTOR
               Did he just confess to killing the
               Wall Street Three?
                         TECHNICAL DIRECTOR
                   (horrified)
               Yeah. I think he did.
                          ASSOCIATE PRODUCER
                   (turns to the director,
                    nods)
               He definitely did.
                         DIRECTOR
               Jesus Christ.
                   (hits the camera talk
                    button, into mic)
               Camera Three, get in close.
     ANGLE ON MONITOR, Camera Three zooming in close on Joker's
     face.

115 INT. TALK SHOW SET, STAGE - CONTINUOUS 115

     Gene Ufland is now standing up from his chair. Motions for
     Murray to kill the interview. Murray shakes his head to
     himself. This is a big "get," it could be great television.
                         MURRAY FRANKLIN
                   (turns back to Joker; with
                    gravitas)
               You're serious, aren't you? You're
               telling us you killed those three
               boys on the subway. Why should we
               believe you?
                                                            110.

                         JOKER
                   (shrugs)
               I got nothing left to lose, Murray.
               Nothing can hurt me anymore. This
               is my fate, it was always my fate.
               My life is nothing but a comedy.

116 INT. SOPHIE'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 116

     Sophie's sitting on her couch watching this interview play
     out on TV. GiGi's asleep next to her. The open envelope and      
     the money are lying on the coffee table. No sign of the          
     flowers anywhere.                                                
                         MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)
               Let me get this straight, you think
               killing those young men is funny?
                         JOKER (ON TV)
               Yeah. But comedy is subjective,
               isn't that what they say? Besides,
               the way I see it, what happened was
               a good thing. All of you, Gotham,
               the system that knows so much, you
               decide, you decide what's right and
               wrong. What's real or what's made
               up. The same way you decide what's
               funny or not.
     Sophie edges forward on the couch, can almost see a hint of
     agreement on her face.

117 INT. TALK SHOW SET, STAGE - STUDIO 4B - CONTINUOUS 117

     Back on set, we can tell by the way Murray's now interviewing
     Joker, talking to him slower, more thoughtfully, that he
     thinks this is gonna get him an Emmy... Maybe even a Peabody.
                          MURRAY FRANKLIN
                   (beat)
               Okay, I think I understand. You did
               it to start a movement, to become a
               symbol.
                         JOKER
               C'mon, Murray, do I look like the
               kind of clown who could start a
               movement? I killed those guys                          
               because they were awful.                               
               Everybody's awful these days. It's
               enough to make anyone crazy.                           
                                                111.

                   MURRAY FRANKLIN
         So that's it, you're crazy. That's
         your defense for killing three
         young men? Because they were mean              
         to you?                                        
                   JOKER
         No. They couldn't carry a tune to              
         save their lives.                              
Some audible groans from the audience.

                   JOKER                                
         Why is everyone so upset about                 
         these guys? Because Thomas Wayne               
         went and cried about them on TV?
                   MURRAY FRANKLIN                      
         You have a problem with Thomas
         Wayne, too?
                   JOKER
         Yeah. I do. Everything comes so
         easy for him.
                   MURRAY FRANKLIN
         And what's wrong with that?
                   JOKER
         Have you seen what it's like out
         there, Murray? Do you ever actually            
         leave the studio? Everybody just               
         yells and screams at each other.               
         Nobody's civil anymore. Nobody
         thinks what it's like to be the
         other guy. You think men like                  
         Thomas Wayne, men at ease, ever
         think what it's like to be a guy
         like me? To be anybody but
         themselves.
             (shaking his head, voice
              rising)
         They don't. They think we'll all
         just sit there and take it like
         good little boys. That we won't
         werewolf and go wild. Well, this is            
         for all of you out there.
Joker "howls at the moon." It's fucking weird.

                                                            112.

118 INT. STATION SQUAD ROOM - 7TH PRECINCT - CONTINUOUS 118

     OFFICERS AND DETECTIVES JUMPING INTO ACTION, rushing past a
     small portable black & white television sitting on one of the
     desks, hear one of them shout--
                         POLICE LIEUTENANT (OS)
               That asshole just confessed to
               killing those Wall Street guys on
               fucking live TV!
     ANGLE ON THE LITTLE TV, TIGHT TWO-SHOT OF JOKER looking at
     Murray.
                         MURRAY FRANKLIN (ON TV)
                   (shakes his head)
               So much self-pity, Arthur. You
               sound like you're making excuses
               for killing three young men. Not
               everybody's awful.                                      

119 INT. TALK SHOW SET, STAGE - STUDIO 4B - CONTINUOUS 119

     Back on set. Joker looks straight at Murray.
                         JOKER
               You're awful, Murray.
     There is no more laughter. The audience is watching this
     exchange with full attention.
                         MURRAY FRANKLIN
               Me? How am I awful?
                         JOKER
               Playing my video, inviting me on                        
               the show,-- You just wanted to make                     
               fun of me. Well it's easy to laugh                      
               at Frankenstein on a crowded beach,                     
               isn't it? You're just like the rest                     
               of them, Murray. Everything comes
               too easy for you.
                         MURRAY FRANKLIN
                   (on the spot; defensive)
               You don't know the first thing
               about me, pal. Look what happened
               because of what you did, Arthur,
               what it led to. There are riots out
               there. Two policemen are in                             
               critical condition, someone was                         
               killed today.                                           
                                                            113.

     Joker nods in agreement, yeah, it's because of what he did.     
                         JOKER                                       
               How about another joke, Murray?                       
               What do you get when you cross a                      
               mentally-ill loner with a system
               that abandons him and treats him
               like trash?
     Murray pauses for a minute, not really listening to Joker,
     suddenly realizing the seriousness of the situation. He
     starts to turn to camera--
                         JOKER
                   (pulls Randall's gun)                             
               I'll tell you what you get. You get                   
               what you fucking deserve,--                           
     And as Murray Franklin turns back to him, JOKER SHOOTS THE
     SIDE OF MURRAY'S HEAD OFF--
     Blood splatters all over the back of the set. Some spraying
     in Joker's face. AUDIENCE SCREAMS! Dr. Sally dives for the
     floor.

120 INT. SOPHIE'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 120

     Sophie screams and jumps to her feet horrified! Waking up
     GiGi who starts to cry when she sees what's on television--
     ON THE TELEVISION, Joker gets up and walks right up to the
     camera. Blood sprayed over his white painted face. Hear the
     studio audience still screaming, bedlam all around him.
                         JOKER (ON TV)
                   (looks straight into
                    camera; screams Murray's
                    signature sign off)
               GOOD NIGHT AND ALWAYS REMEMBER,--                     
               THAT'S LIFE!                                          
     And as Joker waves goodbye to the home audience, a black &      
     white "INDIAN-HEAD TEST PATTERN" cuts off the show--            
     "PLEASE STAND BY"
     HERB ALPERT'S "Spanish Flea" plays underneath.
     Beat.
                                                               114.

121 INT. TALK SHOW SET, STAGE - CONTINUOUS 121

     BACK LIVE IN THE STUDIO, JOKER'S TACKLED BY TWO SECURITY           
     GUARDS AND SOME STAGEHANDS, still hear screams of terror from      
     the audience around him.                                           
     HIS FACE HITS THE SHINY FLOOR AS IF IN SLOW MOTION--               
     And we HEAR the soft and familiar opening to FERRANTE &            
     TEICHER's piano version of "Send in the Clowns".                   
                                                        CUT TO:         

122 INT. GOTHAM SQUAD CAR (MOVING), GOTHAM STREETS - NIGHT 122

     JOKER GAZING OUT THE WINDOW, at all the violence and madness       
     in the city. We only see it in the reflection of the glass...      
     the fires burning... the mob crowding the streets. Joker's         
     handcuffed in the back of the squad car moving slowly through      
     the rioting, sirens wailing, red lights flashing, blood still      
     splattered on his face.                                            
     STAY ON JOKER'S FACE AS HE HEARS THE POLICE RADIO CRACKLING,       
     reports of rioters in "Joker" masks setting fires, breaking        
     windows, looting stores.                                           
     The images reflected in the window start to speed up as the        
     officer driving weaves faster through the chaos.                   
                         POLICE OFFICER #1 (OS)                         
               Look what you caused, you freak,                         
               the whole city's on fire because of                      
               you.                                                     
     AND JOKER BANGS HIS HEAD HARD AGAINST THE STEEL MESH CAGE--        
     BAM.                                                               
                         POLICE OFFICER #2 (OS)                         
               Keep it up, asshole. Watch what                          
               happens when we get to the station.                      
     HE BANGS HIS HEAD AGAIN. BAM. BAM. Some blood is forming on        
     his forehead--                                                     
                         POLICE OFFICER #1 (OS)                         
                   (glancing at Joker in the                            
                    back seat, shouting)                                
               -- Calm the fuck down, you're not                        
               going anywhere!                                          
     And when the cop driving turns back, catch a glimpse of            
     someone or something running out into the street in front of       
     the speeding squad car--                                           
                                                            115.

     CLOSE ON JOKER AS THE SQUAD CAR SWERVES OUT OF THE WAY, Joker    
     banging up against the door--                                    
     CRAAAASSSHHHHHH!!!!                                              
     The squad car hits a parked car hard and flips over, sliding     
     across the street on its roof--                                  

123 EXT. SQUAD CAR (SLIDING), STREET - CONTINUOUS 123

     SPARKS FLY UNTIL FINALLY THE UPSIDE DOWN SQUAD CAR COMES TO A    
     STOP. Smoke rising from the wreck. Ferrante & Teicher's piano    
     only version of "Send in the Clowns" still playing...            
     Both police officers in the front seat are either unconscious    
     or dead. We see movement in the back seat, hard to tell          
     what's going on inside.                                          
     Suddenly the back door kicks open--                              
     And Joker falls out of the car, landing hard on the street,      
     one hand free, handcuffs dangling from his other hand. Hear      
     sirens in the distance--                                         
     JOKER LEANS BACK AGAINST THE CAR, his face bloody, his body      
     broken from the crash. Sitting there amongst the wreckage,       
     can still see and hear the chaos, the fires burning all          
     around him. He reaches for a jagged shard of broken glass--      
     And pauses for moment catching his breath, hand holding the      
     jagged glass resting on his lap, wailing sirens getting          
     closer, looks like he's about to cut his wrists--                

124 EXT. MOVIE THEATER, STREET - UPTOWN - CONTINUOUS 124

     A WELL-HEELED CROWD LETTING OUT OF A MOVIE THEATER, the          
     violence has even reached up here, the nice part of town...      
     Sirens wailing, gangs of punks wearing "Joker" masks running     
     past, breaking car windows, fires burning... Catch a glimpse     
     of the lit up marquee listing the films playing, "Blow Out"      
     and "Zorro the Gay Blade". Hear "Send in the Clowns" still       
     playing...                                                       
     FROM BEHIND SEE A SILHOUETTED COUPLE AND THEIR KID hurry down    
     the dark side of the street, ducking into an alley to avoid      
     the chaos--                                                      
     Catch a glimpse of a punk in a "Joker" mask following after      
     them pulling a gun--                                             
                                                             116.

125 EXT. SQUAD CAR (UPSIDE DOWN), STREET - CONTINUOUS 125

     Joker lifts the jagged shard of glass, handcuff swinging...        
     Passes by his wrist... And starts cutting into the slit on         
     one corner of his mouth, making his smile longer and wider.        
     Blood pouring down his face, onto his hand...                      
     Joker tearing into the other side of his mouth, jagged glass       
     ripping into his flesh, spurting blood, handcuff swinging--        
     Sirens on top of him, red lights flashing over his face--          
     ANGLE ON JOKER LIT UP RED, done cutting his smile, letting go      
     of the jagged bloody shard... Leans his head back against the      
     squad car, and closes his eyes, covered in his own blood.          
     He's finished.                                                     
     Now he is the Joker.                                               

126 EXT. ALLEY, MOVIE THEATER - CONTINUOUS 126

     FROM BEHIND, FAMILY IN THE SHADOWS sees the guy's eyes go          
     wide behind the mask, pointing his gun, music swelling--           
                         PUNK                                           
                   (shouting)                                           
               You still think we're all fucking                        
               clowns?                                                  
     And the punk shoots the man. Reaches out and grabs something       
     off the woman's neck before he shoots her as well. Both fall       
     to the ground dead. Revealing their young son standing behind      
     them--                                                             
     CLOSE ON EIGHT-YEAR-OLD BRUCE WAYNE, closing his eyes as           
     blood sprays across his face. He opens his eyes and looks up       
     scared at the man in the "Joker" mask who killed his parents,      
     Thomas and Martha Wayne. "Send in the Clowns" ends.                
                                                   CUT TO BLACK.        
     A long beat.                                                       
     HEAR LAUGHTER.                                                     
     The sound of a man totally cracking up.                            
                                                         FADE IN:       

127 INT. ARKHAM STATE HOSPITAL, INTERVIEW ROOM - MORNING 127

     CLOSE ON JOKER, tears in his eyes from laughing so hard. He's      
     enjoying it, not trying to get it under control.                   
                                                      117.

His head's been shaved. He looks medicated or maybe even lobotomized. Wearing white institutional clothes.

HIS NEW SMILE IS ALL STITCHED UP, cut deep up the corners of his mouth. Forming a longer, "happier" smile.

He's sitting across from an overworked HOSPITAL DOCTOR (50's), African American woman. Somehow it's the exact same room Joker imagined his mother was in some 30 years ago. The room and the doctor also look vaguely similar to the social worker and her office in the opening scene.

The doctor just sits there, waiting for him to stop laughing. A weathered notebook is on the table in front of him. Finally, Joker stops himself.

                   HOSPITAL DOCTOR                              
         What's so funny?                                       
He takes a deep breath, his eyes are glazed over. His voice is scratchy, like he doesn't use it much.

                   JOKER                                        
         -- just thinking of this joke.                         
                   HOSPITAL DOCTOR                              
         Do you want to tell it to me?                          
Beat.

                     JOKER                                      
         No.                                                    
                   HOSPITAL DOCTOR                              
         Because you don't think I'll get                       
         it?                                                    
                   JOKER                                        
         Because it's personal, it's between                    
         me and him.                                            
Beat.

                   HOSPITAL DOCTOR                              
         Okay. Is the medication working?                       
         How's your sleeping?                                   
                     JOKER                                      
               (nods yes)                                       
         ...                                                    
                   HOSPITAL DOCTOR                              
         How are you feeling?                                   
                                                              118.

                         JOKER                                         
               Good. Everything's good now.                            
                         HOSPITAL DOCTOR                               
               Have you been writing in your                           
               journal?                                                
     Joker slowly nods.                                                
                         HOSPITAL DOCTOR                               
               Great. I want to make sure you're                       
               keeping up with it.                                     
                            JOKER                                      
                   (beat)                                              
               Yeah.                                                   
                         HOSPITAL DOCTOR                               
               Have you written about your                             
               episode? About what happened?                           
                         JOKER                                         
               How I remember it.                                      
                          HOSPITAL DOCTOR                              
                   (re: the journal)                                   
               Can I see?                                              
     Joker slides his journal across to her. She picks it up and       
     flips through the pages--                                         
     ANGLE ON JOURNAL, blank page after blank page, there's            
     nothing inside of it.                                             
     The doctor looks up at him confused.                              
     ANGLE ON JOKER, a smile creeping across his face. And we HEAR     
     the groovy organ opening to FRANK SINATRA's anthem "That's        
     Life"...                                                          
     Beat.                                                             

128 INT. HALLWAY, ARKHAM STATE HOSPITAL - MORNING 128

     From behind, see Joker shuffling down the hallway past all        
     the other mental patients, an orderly by his side. Sinatra        
     starts singing.                                                   
     And Joker does a slide step to the music like he can hear it      
     too... into a skip... and another slide step into a spin...       
     Dancing down the hallway into the sunset...                       
                                                      IRIS OUT:

Outta my face. You're blocking my view.		
Shut up!!! Stop talking. Just go the hell away!		
All the world needs is me. I got my values... so you can keep yours, 		
I don't get people. Never have. Never will.

...Ungh! What the hell is going on!? Somebody! Help!		
Hey... Everybody stop ignoring me! What is this place...		
Crap! I gotta run!		
Man, here we go again...		
Stop whining. We haven't had work in, like, forever.		
Exactly. It feels like the Monday after vacation.		
You'd prefer a permanent vacation? Day 1 has the most Players. Now's		
Aight, aight... One week won't kill me. Probably. Hey, while we're at		
A gaaame?		
Yeah, so it doesn't feel so much like work. C'mon, you love it.		
Oh, yeah. You know me. Sigh... All right. What's the game?		
How 'bout Reaper Sport 3, a Player hunt? Let's see who bags the most		
Are you joking? That's no fun at all!		
You don't like it?		
But I'm gonna crush you! There's no contest.		
Ohh, zing! Now I have to actually try. You know the drill. Loser buys		
Huff, huff... Should be...safe...here...

They're gonna get me...		
Huh?		
You! Forge a pact with me!		
Uhh... I've kinda got my hands full...		
Listen! If we forge a pact, we can beat the Noise!		
Who cares about a little noise?		
You wanna be erased? Hurry up! There's no time! Make a pact with me!		
A-all right! I accept.		
What's with the lights show?		
Here!		
Use this pin!		
But...the funny lights...		
I'll explain later! Right now we have to stop the Noise!		
Uhh...OK?		
Get ready!		
That fire... I did that!?		
Whoa! You can use the pin? You must be really good at psychs. Guess I		
That's what you call those flames? A psych?		
Yup. And now that we've made a pact, the Noise won't come after us!		
In other words, we're safe.		
Right. See? All gone.		
All gone. So...What are Noise?		
They're the monsters we just fought. Duh.		
(Monsters? Uh, sure... And "psychs"?)		
(Is that what this pin is for?)		
Anyway, where are my manners? My name's Shiki Misaki. Call me Shiki.		
(I call this wack.)		
We've got a long week ahead of us!		
A week? Week of what?		
The Reapers' Game is seven days long, right?		
(Reapers? Excuse me? Who is this flake?)		
So what's your name?		
(Forget her... Where am I? How did I get here?)		
C'mon, tell me your name.		
(The sign says "Shibuya Station"... Why am I in Shibuya?)		
Something wrong?		
(Wait... The intersection. I just need to retrace my steps.)		
! Hey, whoa... Wait for me!!!		
Why are you following me!?		
Why are you making yourself so hard to follow?		
Screw you. I go where I want.		
Go where? We're trapped in here!		
What? Don't be stupid.		
You're the one being stupid. We made a pact. We're supposed to stick		
Survive what?		
The Game! Don't you wanna win?		
Pfft. Play games on your own time.		
Hey! That's not funny! They'll erase us if we don't win! You saw what		
No way! Don't make me a part of this.		
You're already a part of this. You're a Player, just like me.		
A what? I'm not playing anything.		
Oh yeah? Then why do you have a Player Pin?		
Don't you have a timer on your hand? I do...		
What. The. Hell.		
See, you're part of the Reapers' Game, too.

Ten-Four! 104? You got the mail, right? "Reach 104 or face erasure."

Good. Now, for the last time... Tell me your name.		
...... Acro. Acro Sakuraba.		
Acro, huh? Cute name.		
(Shut up.)		
All right, Acro. Let's go over to 104!		
Hey, Acro!		
......		
We have to get over to 104. There's no time!		
......		
Hey- wait up!!! Acro...		
I told you! We can't leave!		
Oh, please.		
Durff! You gotta be kidding me!		
Next time, try listening.		
So this is all part of that "Reapers' Game"?		
That's right.		
(This is nuts. She's actually telling the truth? Then that		
Acro! Move! We have to get to Ten-Four!		
Oww! It's blocked! There's no way past!		
We can't get through!? But this is the way to Ten-Four!

Pact confirmed.		
What are we gonna do about this wall? [walks past Acro] Huh? Acro!		
? What's up with that?		
No idea. A lucky break, I guess! C'mon, we gotta keep moving.		
(Something about that guy in red...) ! (Huh? Where'd he go? Weird.)		
Made it!		
The timer vanished!		
Whew! Mission complete.		
!?		
What!?		
Only an idiot would screw up on Day 1.		
Who's there!?		
Oh, no... A Reaper?		
Reaper...		
You two are gonna get erased sooner or later. So come on. Help a girl		
Those monsters again...		
Acro, you know how to fight now, right? This time focus your thoughts 		
What? Fight your own battles!		
Please! To stop the Noise!		
...Fine. Come on!		
Good! Now we can fight together! We can beat the Noise faster as a		
Is it over?		
Not yet, Acro! Over there!

I...I won't!

Hey!		
Aaack! Don't scare me like that!		
(Grow up. You're obnoxious...)		
Umm...Is something wrong?		
Where are we?		
Isn't this the underpass by the station? I can hear the trains.		
(That's weird. How'd we get here?)		
There's the mission!

Oww!

(So now we're trapped in here.)		
No... We'll never finish the mission now.

Because this is the way to Hachiko.

I can't read him.		
What!? You can't scan him?		
(I had no trouble scanning people yesterday. Maybe the rules changed?)		
(Or maybe the pin is broken.)		
Can we finish the mission without being able to scan?		
(Hmm... What if it's just him? Maybe he's special.)		
Acro!		
(Ugh...) What now!?		
That guy is coming right towards us!		
You. Scan and erase all the Noise in this area.		
Huh? What are you talking about?		
(Are those the conditions to move on?)		
I don't see any Noise!		
The world is more than just what you see. [he walks off]		
He left. What a creepy guy.		
(I don't know what his deal is... But he's part of the Game, that's for		
("The world is more than just what you see." So to find the Noise...)		
How? They're not here!		
Yes they are. We have to scan for them.		
You think? All right! Let's try it. But first... I meant to ask you.		
Shouldn't you try some other pins? You've got more, right?		
Pins?		
Yeah! They should've given you a whole bunch.		
(You're right... In my pocket.)		
Why not test them out?		
How?		
Remember the flame pin yesterday?		
This one?		
Well, I wasn't able to use it. So maybe--		
I get it. Certain pins only work for certain people. I've got to try		
(We need to defeat some Noise to proceed. I can see 'em with		
Hey, why don't you try those new pins out? If anybody can 		
You were right. We have to scan to see the Noise.		
(That takes care of them all.)		
Objective met.		
But what about the wall? It's still-- Huh!? It's gone! Why?		
Because we took out the Noise.		
So that's the trick to getting past the walls. But...that's odd.		
What's odd?		
I heard you can only beat the Noise in pairs. But I fought them alone.		
Hmm, me too...		
I couldn't see you while I was fighting.		
!?		
Huh?		
The Noise exist simultaneously in two zones. And the only way to		
Wait, but-- What is with that guy?		
(He knows too much... He must be one of them.)		
Well, anyway...You did great.		
What?		
You were able to use all the pins!		
So?		
You're like some sort of psych genius!		
(Come on. Using a couple of pins doesn't make anyone a genius. Don't be		
Huh? Acro. You have two Player Pins.		
So?		
So why two? You only need one.		
(How should I know? Why do I have any of them? I need them for psychs, 		
Well, umm... Two is better than one! So, like, don't feel bad!		
(You're the one who said I only need one...)		
Think how lucky I am! My partner's a psych whiz. A genius! You're a		
(If you're going to flatter someone... you could try to sound a little		
Acro, you listening?		
......		
Stop that. I'm just trying to be nice.		
I'm listening.		
Well, how am I supposed to tell when you just stand there? You should		
Would you shut the hell up! I just met you. I don't like you. And I		
You don't have to yell... What am I going to do? ......		
(Now she's playing with her phone? Forget this.)		
Hey! Wait up!		
Where are you going? I'm your partner!		
! Wha-- Who's there!?		
You got us good yesterday, but today I'ma crush you, yo!		
Um... What? You've got the wrong person. Acro, you know this guy?		
Don't insult me.		
Need a hint? Go ask your friends.		
"Friends"? What are you talking about?		
Shut up, yo! You ain't foolin' me! I can't scan you. You gotta be 		
Wait! Just--		
What?		
See? They've got Player Pins. Players must not be able to scan each		
...... Oh. Yo, sorry I jumped to conclusions...		
No worries. You just gave us a start.		
Yesterday this pink-haired chick cornered us before we could get to		
So that's why you were out for payback.		
Yup. ...Hey, hold up. We should do introductions. The name's Beat. And		
Hello!		
Hi! I'm Shiki. That over there's Acro. He's my partner.		
......		
Wha's with the phones? He still mad?		
No...he's just Acro. Don't feel bad.		
...Hey, I know! Lemme give you a tip to make up for jumpin' yas. You		
You mean our cell phones? Well...we don't get any calls... Sending		
We played around a bit and found some things--		
Whoa, you mean you ain't usin' yours? You two gonna get owned down the		
Umm... I guess...		
It's cool! You two got questions, ask us. Gotta put our heads together,		
So about the phone...		
Yeah. You can use it to pick out your pins.		
Pick them out? How?		
Well...		
Why don't you take this pin? Then you can try it out!		
We can keep it?		
Sure. We had extras.		
Wow! Thanks!		
So who's the girl with the pink hair?		
Heh, that cow?		
She attacked us in the scramble crossing. Those black wings...She's		
Yeah, we couldn't scan her.		
So, it doesn't work on Reapers...		
Or on other Players, apparently.		
Guess we found that out the hard way.		
Sorry...		
So if she's a Reaper, does that mean she gives out the missions?		
Who knows... Yo, that reminds me-- 'sup with today's mission? It don't		
Yeah, about that...		
Do you know anything about the Reaper's Game?		
Just that you have to stay alive for seven days.		
The Reapers send them?		
Gotta be. It's their Game, right?		
And if we fail the mission, they erase us.		
...Maybe not.		
! Really!?		
Beat and I never made it to 104. But here we are.		
So like... we don't gotta play? Sweet!		
It's too early to say. We should carry out the missions. I don't want		
Hmm... Ours went away when we got to 104.		
Hey, you think you and Acro finishing the mission might've got		
What's your take on the mission?		
The cursed sculpture or whatever?		
It's gotta be Hachiko.		
Yeah! That's just what I said! But what's the curse?		
Hmm... You got me.		
We should probably start by heading that way.		
Can't. There's a wall, yo.		
Again? What's up with that? We keep hitting these invisible walls...		
I think we trapped in here, or somethin'. I tried breakin' the walls, 		
But some you can get through.		
Hmm...		
We noticed guys in red by the walls we were able to pass.		
Thanks for all the info! 'Specially about the phone! That's gonna be a		
Heh heh. Good! Always happy to help.		
I feel ready to take on anything!		
Yeah, well-- you might not wanna say that. Rhyme's thinkin' things is		
They say two heads are better than one. And four has to be better than		
Great idea! I am so in! It'll be more fun that way. Right, Acro?		
...Do what you want. I work alone.		
What!? Acro, you can't mean that!		
Forget it. I can't take one more minute of your nagging. I don't need a		
Acro! How can you say that?		
(Don't ask me. Maybe I'm just angry.)		
We're on your si--		
I can't scan you. You could be Players... or you could be Reapers. I		
But the Player Pins!		
That's not enough.		
Yo, Phones! What the hell's your problem!? We just lookin' out for you,		
Don't get angry, Beat... I can see where Acro's coming from. I 		
Aw, Rhyme... Rrgh... You piece a' DIRT! Screw you! We don't want your		
Wait, no! We're sorry! ...They left. Nice going, Acro! We should all		
Then why don't you go with them?		
Listen to yourself... We're partners, Acro. But I don't understand 		
Let yourself in. You can scan me.		
You know that's impossible! Besides, we're right here. Let's just talk		
And say what? I'm not opening up to anyone. Ever. Other people just		
N-Acro! Sigh... Tell me what I'm supposed to do...		
So Acro, have you got the hang of wearing pins? You can't		
......		
(That guy... Who is he talking to?)		
...Tell me what's ailing you. ...We're not all made of stone.		
......		
Acro. Give the man some space...		
......		
......		
(Another guy in red. We must be headed towards a--)		
Ouch! A wall.		
(I knew it.)		
So... We just have to defeat some Noise, right?		
(She is so SLOW! Do I have to do everything?)		
Acro! Where are you--		
I know what you are.		
My terms: Lift the statue's curse.		
You're a Reaper.		
I don't get paid to chitchat. Play the Game.		
(Hmph. That was a waste of time. Lift the statue's curse, huh? That		
Please, STOP walking off without me!		
Hey.		
Arrgh! My name is Shiki. Can you say "Shiki"?		
Hey, I see another statue.		
Oh yeah! The Moyai!		
Like Easter Island? What's a Moai doing here?		
"Moyai"! With a Y! Never thought about where it came from...		
Think it's cursed?		
I don't know. It looks pretty normal to me.		
Let's find out.		
So we need to lift the statue's curse. Which means that Moai-		
Mo-YAI.		
(Whatever. Let's check it out.)		
Noise!?		
That must be the curse. Maybe if we erase all that Noise, we can lift 		
Acro!		
I know, I'll take care of it. The Noise buzzing around the 		
Objective met.		
So the Moyai was possessed by Noise... and we had to scan to find it.		
(The guy in red... Yup. He's gone. But we can probably get through		
We freed the cursed sculpture. Does that mean we cleared the mission?		
No, that was just to cross the wall. See? My clock's still ticking.		
Yeah...mine too. Well, at least the wall's gone.		
Let's go find this "Hachiko"...Our real target.		
Acro... You talk like you've never heard of it.		
Nope. What's Hachiko?		
WHAT!? How can you live in this country and not know Hachiko?		
......		
Remember where we met yesterday? There's a statue of a dog in the		
......		
Not again...		
......		
...... All Right! Fine. Let's just head for Hachiko.		
C'mon, Acro. Let's head over to Hachiko!		
...Oh. ...You're all better now! ...I'm so glad.		
(He can tell!? In a way, that's pretty impressive.)		
...Hey. ...Hachiko seems down lately. ...Don't you think?		
(Hachiko is feeling down? Does that mean it's cursed, too?)		
...... That young lady... She has just the ingredient I need.		
We made it! And with plenty of time left!		
(This is where we met yesterday... So the two places are connected.)		
OK! Let's lift Hachiko's curse!		
And how do you propose we do that?		
Well...umm... Maybe we could erase the Noise around it, or...yeah.		
(She's clueless. This is why I can't count on other people. ...They're		
Hey, I bet Hachiko's possessed by Noise, too. Scan the 		
(But doesn't that seem too... easy?)		
No Noise around the statue...		
You tried scanning? Then Hachiko must not be cursed?		
(Could we have the wrong statue?)		
Huh? Hey, look, Acro!		
(Crap...We don't have time to hunt for another statue...)		
EARTH TO Acro!		
What!		
Something's wrong with Hachiko.		
Like what?		
Hmm...I'm not sure. But it looks different from when I saw it at Hachi		
Then let's take a closer look.		
Hmm... Something about him seems different.		
(Let's get a closer look.)		
Hmm...Something is definitely off. When I saw him at Hachi Fest, 		
(I should get a closer look...)		
Hmm...Hachiko seems less...lovable?		
What's Hachi Fest?		
Oh, it's a blast! It's this festival where you touch Hachiko 		
Wow. Charming.		
They hold it every year. And each time, the place you have to		
...You explode?		
You get cursed!		
Hmm... Sound pretty extreme.		
So this cure...		
Umm... I know something's off...		
(Well, you just take your time. Cause, you know, we've got so much of 		
So, Hachiko's curse...		
Why don't we start scanning around? Somebody else may know		
...Hey. ...Hachiko seems down lately. ...Don't you think?		
(What is it with this guy and statues?)		
...He must be like you. ...Drifting in a sea of woes... ...If only I		
Polish away Hachiko's pain? That's...idiotic.		
Hey... Acro, we should try that!		
Try WHAT?		
Polishing! Hachiko did look a little dirty. And I saw this weird		
(Or what if someone just went crazy with a magic marker? Well, if 		
Yeah!		
Yes! Now we can free Hachiko from the curse. Let's hurry		
(...Do you ever shut up?)		
What should we do, Acro?		
(I might be missing something... I should gather more info.)		
OK, Acro! Let's polish like we mean it!		
Isn't that gonna...you know...create a scene?		
Don't worry! No one's watching. And so what if they see us?		
(See us petting a piece of ROCK?) All right. Whatever...		
OK, Acro, let's polish like we mean it!		
Grr...		
You say something, Acro?		
Nope.		
You know... It seems the more we polish... the less this looks like		
GRRRRR....		
Stop growling and polish!		
I'm not growling...		
Acro, something came out of the statue!		
Acro, we did it! The timer's gone! So there was Noise possessing both		
And our mission was to get rid of both.		
Hey, Acro...		
Yeah?		
You said before you don't need any friends.		
Yeah. Your point?		
Well, you couldn't have solved Hachiko's riddle without me.		
What? Get real.		
If I hadn't noticed the pattern, we might not have cleared the 		
Listen, Stalker. I don't need you to solved one stupid riddle.		
Riiight. Well, if you ask me--		
!?		
Huh!?		
That voice... You were at 104 yesterday!		
You're that Reaper!		
Well, excuuuse me for doing my job.		
Then it's true?		
(A Reaper... She gives out the missions?)		
You know, you owe me a bowl of ramen. For not disappearing like you're		
(This...girl is a Reaper?)		
What's wrong? Too spooked to answer? Well, this should bring you 		
Huff...huff...		
(Nngh... These Noise are tougher than the others...)		
Wow. You're, like, stronger than I thought. But I'm not done playing		
(No... I can't keep this up... I've got one chance.)		
Hmm?		
(I have to take her out!)		
Please tell me you're not planning on fighting me? Ha ha ha ha! How		
(What!? She erased her own Noise?)		
You seem surprised.		
Aren't the Noise on your side?		
Eww, gross! Don't group us together. The Noise are nothing but tools.		
(Rrgh...I can't let this brat win! But can I stop her? I have no idea		
Don't, Acro! You don't want to take her on! She can erase you in a		
Hmph.		
Aww, what? You're giving up? Booo-ring. Don't get my hopes up like 		
Huh!?		
But...I can't do that.		
(Huh?)		
Well, this is a pickle... Hmm... I know! Let's try something fun! A		
You...you will?		
You betcha! Sweet deal, huh? So, like, what do you say?		
(A ticket out...)		
Acro, don't! Don't listen!		
You back there. Shut up! Now, are you in, or are you out?		
...I'm in.		
Acro!		
Whee! 'Atta boy! Now, let's get started. Oh, I forgot to mention. If 		
What!?		
Thankfully the rules are veeery simple. You have one minute...to erase		
What? Erase her?		
Yup. Poof! Kaput! Easy, right? Just pretend you're erasing the Noise.		
(W-wait! Dammit... She's asking me to kill someone. There's no way I		
Acro...		
30 seconds! Still on the fence? Then let me give you an incentive.		
What? She's a spy?		
Hey! What are you saying!		
Thanks for checking in so often. We couldn't have done it without you.		
Shut up! Don't lie! Acro...She's making all of this--		
Your phone. Why did you keep playing with your phone?		
Huh!? Oh... I was...just...		
Just SPYING. She's not very good at covering it up.		
I didn't spy! I swear!		
G'bye. And thanks for playing. 10 seconds... You're the star, kiddo.		
......		
What are you waiting for? Do what comes naturally. Save yourself.		
Don't, Acro. Don't kill me...		
I have to.		
Please...don't kill me.		
I have to		
Don't Kill me. Chapter Closed]		
Nngh... ! What is this place? It's dark... Is it nighttime? No, I'm

If I use this pin for a light... ? Huh? It doesn't work. So I can't use		
! (Footsteps? Somebody's coming this way...)		
Show yourself!		
Ahhh!		
You?		
Acro!? You scared the crap out of me! Don't do that.		
I scared YOU? Where the hell have you been?		
It was dark. I was looking for a way out! I must've tripped a half a		
(Hmm, time to try this again.)		
Acro, pins only work when we fight Noise.		
Really?		
Well...with a few exceptions.		
(Like psychokinesis...) W-well...It's dark. You should be more careful.		
You kidding? I already found the exit!		
Then why didn't you lea--		
I'm not going anywhere without you.

C'mon, I'm not that useless, am I?		
...... Don't do anything dumb like wander off.		
Excuse me? Which one of us has been acting dumb?		
.......		
What are you waiting for? Do what comes naturally. Save yourself.		
Don't, Acro. Don't kill me...		
I have to.		
Now let's see some results!

Ah-ah-ah, sister. You gotta play by the rules. Making "erase your

I know that. I was just having a little postgame fun.

One mission per day. That's the rule. And only the Game Master can		
I know that, too! But I'm not the Game Master. Which MEANS this wasn't

...Hmph. For a Player... you know a lot about our rules.		
You...you tricked me! All that about letting me out of the Game-- that

Acro?		
I want to understand me, too... But I don't.		
What...		
I can't remember anything but my name. I woke up in the intersection		
But... That means...what? You have amnesia?		
......		
Sorry to hear it, boss...That's rough.		
I can't believe you've lost your memory... You could've told me		
I didn't know.		
It did strike me as kind of strange that you knew nothing about		
What, like you do?		
Well, I don't know EVERYTHING, but... Anyway. We got lucky. Thanks to		
Ahhh! That almost gave me a heart attack!		
Hey, you dropped your phone--		
Ahh! Don't touch it! I got it!!!		
(Nice photo.)		
...You looked?		
The screen was face up...		
That's my friend. She was in my class.		
So all those times--		
Yeah. I was looking at this.		
And you yell at me for keeping secrets! It's just a photo. You don't		
Look, Acro! The mission mail!		
(...Huh? She's covering? What else does she have to hide?)		
"Defeat the master of A-East. You have 360 minutes. Fail, and face		
Oww!		
The timer. Guess we'd better get started.		
OK! Today's mission has something to do with A-East.		
? A-East?		
It's the name of a concert space. I've been there a bunch of times.		
You seem to know Shibuya pretty well.		
Of course! I hang out here all the time. Follow me! I'll take you to		
First things first.		
(The exit.)		
!? Wait a sec...		
What now?		
Umm... We're here, heh heh...		
You mean we were inside A-East the whole time? You know--		
How was I supposed to tell? They had all the lights off!		
......		
We're ahead of schedule, so no griping. Now let's go defeat that 		
It was too dark to see anything inside.		
Then we better take care of the lights. Otherwise we're more likely to		
How do we restore power? (Somebody around here must know...)		
We won't get anywhere without light.		
Let's do some recon. I bet somebody around here can point us		
Tsk, the hell is he? We gotta rehearse.		
(What's that guy grumbling about?)		
Hey, perfect! You two.		
! Huh?		
Can we help you?		
H-h-hey! Wait a sec--		
Think you could do a guy a favor?		
Sure, if we can be of any help.		
Shh! What're you--		
Let's hear him out. Sometimes all people need is a good listener. We		
(You sap... Look at the bigger picture!)		
My band's supposed to play here in a few hours, but the tech's been gone		
So this tech's part of the concert crew?		
That's right. He's in a black tee. Got a lanyard 'round his		
Why can't you go find him?		
Cause I got a concert. I can't go wondering off. The name's 777		
777...		
777... ! No way! Like 777, "Def M  " vocalist and rising		
Oh, you've heard of us? Rock on. We're still totally indie. But		
Whoa, are you all right?		
Yeah, my throat's just sore. I had to shout a lot during load-		
Oh, you poor thing..		
(No tech, no show, huh? So if we find the guy...) You can rehearse if 		
Of course! It's that, or call off the show. So how 'bout it? Will you 		
We want to help, but... We don't really have time...do we?		
......		
Sorry, but we've got stuff to do.		
It's cool. I'm sure you're busy. Just, if you see him? Tell 		
All right. We will.		
Thanks!		
(...Is that her idea of saying no?)		
Sure, we'll do it.		
What? We will!?		
Yup.		
Thanks, man! You rock! If you see him, tell him to haul it back to		
OK.		
Hee hee!		
Ugh, stop laughing.		
Sorry, I've just never seen you act so...nice.		
(...She still doesn't get it.) If the tech comes back, he can turn 		
Oh... Duh! Acro, that's brilliant!		
Plus, that 777 guy? He's a--		
Now we can help 777 AND finish the mission!		
(Sigh...)		
A black tee and lanyard... I don't see anyone like that		
I'll be here waiting. Thanks again!		
...... Want past this wall? Then here. Defeat the Noise!		
Another wall.		
No big deal. We know how to handle it now.		
! Hey! Why don't we try that pin?		
Oh, the one Mr. Hanekoma gave us?		
OK, Phones! In honor of your growth as a human being, and a friendship		
(OK, but... First, could YOU remember my name?) Um, Mr. Hanekoma. It's		
! Oh, right! Sorry, Acro. My bad. I got it now.		
(I wonder.)		
So let's start with some Q & A. You got questions? I got answers.		
To win the "Reapers' Game"... you must complete seven missions, one 		
So...is it true that if we don't, we'll be erased?		
Well, only if you fail, to be precise.		
Huh?		
You two aren't the only Players. If any one Player completes the		
Then we don't have to play.		
Ah, but if you all think like that and ignore the missions--		
Then we all wind up erased.		
Furthermore, the Reapers grade the Players.		
Grade us?		
Naturally, you get points for finishing a mission.		
But...what are the grades for?		
On the seventh day, you'll know. Just clear the missions. You'll be 		
What are Reapers?		
Their main job are running the Game, and testing the Players. So like		
She was such a creep...		
So they're like some kind of group?		
Yes! Very sharp, Phones. You've seen the guys in red, by the walls?		
(I knew it.)		
Whoa, really? But the guys by the walls never attacked us.		
Not all Reapers are cut from the same cloth. Some are Harriers; others		
So they don't fight.		
The Harriers, on the other hand, hunt Players for a living. It's not		
So we're their lunch.		
Everybody's gotta eat, kiddo...		
Mr. Hanekoma...Who are you?		
What, me? Pfft... ...... All right. I'll tell you a little. The name's		
I didn't ask for your personal ad.		
I'm a big gambler. My favorite word: "windfall." "Natto" gets my tummy		
Like I said--		
As for my physical dimensions,		
Stop. Please.		
So you run a caf      ? I thought you said you		
The caf      's like a hobby. Tot		
Yeah! I think it's cool.		
(Uhh...what?)		
Drop by my place if you get the chance. I'll give you the best cuppa		
(What kind of invite is that!?)		
This...IS Shibuya, right?		
You bet. But not your Shibuya. It's an alternate Shibuya we call the		
"UG"?		
As in "Underground." The UG is one big chessboard for the Reapers' 		
You expect us to believe that?		
The Shibuya you came from is called the RG. The "Realground."		
So we're in another world?		
No... The RG and UG exist in the same space. What you see is the RG--		
......		
The UG is run by the Composer.		
Who's that?		
Shibuya's supervisor.		
Shibuya has a supervisor? Right.		
I can't say anything more on that subject. It's classified, you dig?		
Now, for that gift I promised...		
In honor of you two making up!		
What is this pin? It's blank. What it's psych?		
This one's a little different. It takes two people to use. It only		
Yeah! You're great at psychs. Way better than me.		
You think?		
There, see? You take good care of that.		
Let's try and get to work, Acro!		
...... (But...I can't use it by myself. I'm supposed to sync up with		
Just to be clear... You need more than talent to use that. It takes		
I'll use it. And please... My name is Acro. Not "Phones."		
! Oh, right! Sorry 'bout that. I got it now, Phones!		
He was quite a character, huh?		
(And really bad with names.)		
What a nice guy, giving us that pin. And fun to talk to.		
I'll give you that. (Something about him just...pulls you in. Not sure		
Acro! Let's try the pin!		
...... (So I have to sync up with her? Pfft, right.)		
What's wrong? Oh, I know. You forgot how it works, right? You're		
......		
Let's see... First, we have to fight in sync.		
(And that's where this all goes to hell.)		
Then, once we've got a groove going, this pin will activate, and you 		
(Great explanation.)		
Ready to give it a shot?		
What? You're not going to fight?		
I'm not ready.		
All right. No rush.		
OK! Here goes nothing!		
...... Come on.		
So, did you get the hang of it? Or do you want to practice some more?		
If we work together... we should get a ton of use out of this!		
......		
Objective met. Wall clear!		
Welcome.		
! Huh!? I thought no one could see us!		
What, did you forget, Acro? It's like Mr. Hanekoma said.		
Inside places with that decal, we become visible so we can do some		
Oh yeah...		
I don't see anyone with a black tee and lanyard.		
He might be indoors.		
Man, screw the concert. Can't they hire another tech?		
! Psst! Acro, did you hear that?		
Yup. Looks like we found our man. Guess he's on strike. (He picked the		
I'm tellin' ya, I've got stage presence! I'm not the behind-the-		
Well, just remember, son. The future is a clean slate, and you're 		
Now have a hot bowl of ramen and cheer... ...up? Hey, where'd he go?		
Acro! The tech just took off!		
What? Dammit! I don't care if I have to DRAG him back to A-East!		
Whew...I just can't deal anymore. Wish I could curl up and forget all		
Wow. Talk about your negative vibes. He'll never come back with us		
Yes, he will. He has to.		
He seems so down. I wonder what's on his mind...		
Dammit, what is he DOING? We need to restore the power.		
!? Hey! He's surrounded by Noise!		
You're right! It's like he's possessed!		
Man, now I feel all out of whack. It just gets worse and worse.		
We should erase the Noise around him.		
Huh? What am I doing here? ! Oh, crap! Look at the time! I gotta get		
Good. Now he'll head back.		
And once he does, we'll have power.		
Pretty weird, though, the way he snapped right out of it.		
Yeah... You think the Noise are out to hijack people's minds?		
But then what about last time? Remember? They erased the people they		
(Maybe they're like the Reapers--not all cut from the same cloth. Or		
Well, either way, they're not good for you! If we see anyone else		
(OK, Captain Sappy. Roger that.)		
C'mon, let's drop by A-East. The tech should be back by now.		
Now we can get some light. Back to A-East!		
The hell you been? Go get us ready for rehearsal!		
I'm sorry, 777... But...the stage lighting's busted.		
It's what? How're we gonna rehearse--no, how're we gonna PLAY THE SHOW!?		
I got a repairman working on it. That's why I was out--to pick up the		
Great! Then we're ready to rock.		
Huh?		
You got the part, right?		
Umm... Define "got"...		
You nimrod! Go get the part. Move it.		
Right away!		
Uh-oh... More trouble?		
Hey! Domo arigato for findin' the tech!		
You're welcome, but... Something wrong?		
Yeah, sounds like our lightings on the fritz. The guy just went hunting		
Guess we're gonna be in the dark a while longer.		
Think the tech's got it covered?		
...Maybe we should check on him.		
Think the tech's got it handled?		
He went north when he took off...		
Maybe we should check up on him.		
...... Want past this wall? Then beat two of these-- where I can see		
Noise symbols are those things we see when we scan, right?		
And we need to erase the kind in his picture.		
OK... Let's get cracking.		
OK! I think we took out the right Noise.		
Me too. Let's hurry up and open the wall!		
...... Objective met. Wall clear! [Wall is lowered]		
! Hey, look! It's Beat and Rhyme. Let's go say hi!		
...... (Why? We're not at a party. What a pain in the rrgh...)		
Look, see? Beat and Rhyme are right over there. Heeey!		
Ugh...		
Beat! Rhyme!		
Heh. Talk about crap for luck, yo. Here comes Phones.		
Gathered any intel for the mission?		
No, not at all. But I know we'll get through it! We just have to take		
But then what's this meme for?		
"Meme"? What's a "meme"?		
......		
I think Shiki could use our help. We can tell her, right?		
Well...aight. But only 'cause it's Shiki.		
So what's a "meme"?		
Memes are words or ideas related to the missions. Whenever we see or		
Blackout? ! Huh? I just got mail... You're right. It showed up on my		
They're for imprinting.		
What's your take on today's mission?		
You mean, "defeat the master of A-East"?		
We were there. It's pitch black. You can't see a thing.		
Pitch black? Hmm... That might explain the meme...		
So memes are for imprinting.		
Meaning...what?		
Oh. Imprinting's one of the Player Pin's powers. You can use it to		
(This pin can do that? )		
Oh yeah! When you imprint--		
Yo, forget it, Rhyme. Don't bother. Phones don't trust us anyway.		
Beat, don't be like that. A problem shared is a problem halved, right?		
Ahh! No, no! There's nothing to worry about.		
C'mon, Rhyme. Le's bounce.		
Hmm... Beat's still mad... I wish we could patch things up.		
(Why? Just leave him alone. Quit worrying about everybody else.)		
Well, at least we know how to imprint memes now. That was nice of 		
But what's the point?		
Well, umm...		
Ahh... What should I do?		
!		
Considering the circumstances... But...no...that won't do.		
What's tearing that guy up?		
It looks like he can't make up his mind. ! Hey! Acro, why don't we try		
OK... Why not? Let's give it a shot.		
...So. Want to try imprinting on that guy?		
Yeah. We need to find out what it does!		
Ahh...What should I do? Considering the circumstances... But...		
...Hmm! Bah. It's no use. Why pretend I have the		
(Ahh...)		
(No matter what I do, it never seems to work out. 		
! ...Blackout? A blackout... That's right! First... I need to,		
Is that guy gonna be OK?		
Well, we know how it works now. We'll work on finesse next time.		
(Is this really gonna help?)		
Man... What do I do? What was that part I need a replacement for? I		
Hey, isn't that the tech?		
Yup. Full of fail, as usual.		
Acro!		
I know. I'll try imprinting.		
Acro! Let's try imprinting on the tech! It might jog his		
Man... This sucks. What was that part I need a replacement for? I		
Sigh... I am so gonna get yelled at.		
(Arrgh... I can't remember.)		
(The guy would know, But I can't wander back now... What 		
! (Blackout...?) Oh yeah! I gotta fix the lighting. And to do that...		
The guy? Was there somebody by the stage?		
Who's this guy the tech mentioned?		
Was there someone fumbling around inside A-East?		
If so, let's hope he has a better memory than the tech.		
How are we gonna find anybody in the dark?		
We don't need light to scan.		
Hey... Good point! What are we waiting for?		
I can't believe he's not back yet! How long could it possibly take to		
...A fuse? Is that what the tech's after?		
That has to be the part he needs. What do you say we give		
Man... This sucks. What was that part I need a replacement for? I		
(Arrgh... I can't remember.)		
(! ...Fuse?) The fuse! I have to fix the lights. And I need a new		
I have to hurry!		
And away he goes.		
Maybe he'll buy the part now. Or maybe he won't... We'd better follow		
Look! He just went inside.		
Let's move.		
Thank you! You saved my life! I'll never forget this!		
Whew! He finally bought what he needs.		
Now maybe we can get some light.		
We should head back, too.		
Maybe, finally, we'll get some light! C'mon, back to A-East!		
Quit playing around!		
Wait, wait-- I got the part!		
Damn right you do! Now fix the lights!		
Eep!		
That should do it!		
Finally we can see inside.		
Yeah. C'mon!		
Now we can face A-East's master! But, um... who or what is 		
Once we face it, we'll know. Just don't let your guard down.		
I...I won't!		
Huh? Still no power...		
What's busted now?		
If the repairman's still in the back, he would know.		
What's the story?		
This should about do it...		
All fixed?		
Yup! Try flipping the breaker.		
OK! Here goes!		
Hmm? No good...The power blew again.		
What!? Why? I thought you fixed it!		
What's wrong now?		
I dunno... Maybe the fuse wasn't the problem.		
!? Wait! Something's in here!		
Huh!?		
It's coming! Get ready!		
Geez! Talk about a heart attack! But...that was the master, right?		
Nope! Clock's still ticking!		
You're kidding! Then...where's the master!?		
No! We're out of time!		
Don't drop the ball now, yo! Here's your "master"!		
Beat! Rhyme!		
Yo, looks like we made it.		
Yup! The timer's gone now. Mission complete.		
But...I'm so confused...		
Huh? It's fixed!		
You sure?		
Uh-huh. The lights should work now.		
OK, I'm gonna go tell the others!		
Looks like they're in business.		
This place is gonna fill right up. We should step outside for now.		
Oh, so taking out the giant bat wasn't enough! Whoops. Good thing you		
Man... You two shoulda gathered more info, yo. I'm talkin' to you,		
Hee hee...		
What, Rhyme?		
Stop trying to act tough, Beat. We didn't have all the info, either! 		
Let me guess. We had to beat the big golden bat first.		
Bwaaah! Yeah... You act like you got the answers now, but you was		
So were you, Beat.		
Bwaaah! Whose side you on, yo?		
Ha ha ha!		
Hee hee.		
Least I got the job done, aight?		
...Heh.		
Hey, I heard that, yo! Who said YOU could laugh at me?		
Look. The concert's starting. Wait...		
Sup now?		
How come we were able to talk to him? You know, 777.		
Cause he's a Reaper.		
WHAT!?		
Mr. Hanekoma explained all this. Did you forget?		
Now listen up. This Shibuya ain't your Shibuya. It's the Composer's		
So we're basically invisible?		
Only those involved in the Game can see you.		
So...the Players, the Reapers, and...you?		
Right.		
Why am I even in this stupid game?		
All Players come from the RG to the UG for a common reason. And each		
What we value most?		
Do we get it back?		
If you win.		
...And if we don't?		
You lose your entry fee forever. And-- well, your right to exist.		
That's right... He mentioned only Reapers and other Players can see		
......		
You think... You think we'll make it?		
We'll make it.		
!		
No matter what!		
Heh. Think you can deliver, Phones?		
Hey, you know... we really do make a good team. Starting tomorrow, 		
I agree! And what doesn't kill us only makes us stronger.		
If Rhyme's down with it, then so am I.		
No objections, Acro?		
(How can I object? I still don't know anything about the UG... Or about		
Hey, Acro. Remember what Mr. Hanekoma said.		
("Trust your partner." I remember. And now I see why. What else can I		
Yay! That settles it. Here's to teamwork!		
Today six Players were erased, sir.		
Six? My, my...		
That puts us at the 50% erased mark, one full day earlier than		
Higashizawa's doing nicely, then.		
Yes, sir. That concludes today's report. We have our regular meeting

Is something amiss, sir?		
No, no... It's just-- I have a feeling that tomorrow's Game will be

Tick, tock, Minamoto. You're 9 minutes and 42 seconds late.		
Tick, tock, yourself, Konishi. Why are we even here? I can think 		
You will address him as "Mr. Kitaniji."		
It's fine. Are we all here?		
Hey, Megs-- Who's the bulldozer?		
Meet Higashizawa-- this session's Game Master. He'll be handling my		
You do me a great honor, sir. Watch! I will turn this week's

Yes, crack your jokes. But his skill is proven.		
That's right. Higashizawa excels-- in tactics, intel, willpower,		
Cooperation is garbage. Anyway, I'm out. This is subtracting from 		
Wait just a-- Mr. Kitaniji hasn't spoken yet!		
Let him do what he wants.		
Yes, sir...		
Now, then...Higashizawa. You're doing very well.		
Thank you, sir! Over half the Players have been erased. The 		
Excellent. I look forward to it. I spoke to the Composer about your		
Thank you very much, sir.		
I feel you are ready...but, I have one condition.		
What, sir? Name it.		
I expect you, as my proxy in the Game, to leave no Player unerased.		
Fear not, sir. The proof is in the pudding. The pudding...of 		
Yawwwn... Where am I now?		
Hey, you awake?		
What are you doing?		
Just people-watching. I mean, look at them all... Shibuya's so 		
(Shibuya sucks. Who needs a town with this many people? All they do is		
But yo, you ever try scanning 'em all? It's like havin' the radio on		
Yeah... Like everybody's values are all trying to come in the loudest.		
Shibuya's a battlefield.		
(Yeah...It is kinda like that. A clash of creeds.)		
But man... All these people, and they can't even see us, yo.		
Yeah... Makes you sad, huh?		
(Sad!? I'm thankful. Nobody sees me. Nobody bothers me. And nobody

Nothing the four of us can't handle!		
Yeah!		
"Reach Towa Records. No time limit. Fail, and face erasure. --The		
Huh? No time limit? But...that's waaay simple!		
Towa Records is a ten-minute walk. Why wouldn't they set a time limit?		
So we're just walkin' a couple blocks? Man. I was pumped for a brawl, 		
Guess we don't need to team up.		
......		
(But this is too weird. Hundred yen says they've got something else up		
Yo, hold up! I jus' got a great idea!		
Like, what gives, Kariya!? Who made today's mission for ages 3 and 		
Aight, easy, girl. Deep breaths. Stress is bad for your complexion.		
Well, excuse me! Easy missions make me furious! Ugh. I need to go		
Whoa, let's think about this. Put yourself in the Players' shoes.		
Hmph... Point taken. Guess the boss thought it through.		
Sides... Days off are like love letters from the higher-ups. We		
Please. Since when does your dial even GO to full blast?		
Details. Anyway, we've got our own orders straight from the boss.		
All right... You win. Let's see how this plays out.		
I wonder what Beat's great idea is.		
Don't get your hopes up. (The real mystery is today's		
...Yooo! Where you goin'!?		
What's up?		
Like I said, I got a great idea!		
Yeah?		
So what's your great idea?		
How 'bout you two race us two, and we see who gets to Towa Records 		
Whaaat?		
C'mon, Rhyme, le's book it!		
Wha...huh!? Wait, Beat!		
Heh heh... Beat's got a lot of energy, huh?		
Yeah. He keeps me on the ball. Sometimes he can get a little crazy,		
Wow, so you-- ! Omigosh. Rhyme, is that what I think it is?		
Huh? What?		
That pendant! Where did you find one?		
Oh, this? Yeah, I heard they sold out quick. How'd you know about it?		
I saw it in a magazine. I looove following the latest clothes and		
I'm sorry I can't give you mine. But it was a present from my brother.		
You've got a brother?		
Yeah. Older. He's really nice. Hope he's OK...		
Oh, I'm sure he's doing great. And you'll see him soon!		
Yeah... I hope so. So you're into fashion?		
Totally! I want to be a designer. I love making clothes. But right now		
I still think it's pretty cool. It must be nice to have a dream-- to		
Why not? You don't have any dreams?		
No... But when I look at Beat I think: keep moving forward. Because		
Yeah.		
Beat's really good at skateboarding. He says his dream is to be the		
YO, RHYME! Whatchu doin'? Move it! We don't want Phones to win!		
Just a minute, Beat! Patience is a virtue! Well, I'd better go. See 		
Whoa! Beat's just a speck now. Rhyme must have a rough time keeping		
(I'll say.)		
So, um, shouldn't we hurry?		
I never agreed to race. If he wants to run, good for him.		
Then we can slow down for a bit?		
Sure, why not? There's no time limit, and those two have got a head		
So...we can take a little side trip?		
Where are you going with this?		
Mind if we stop at Ten-Four?		
...I guess not.		
Really? Thanks!		
So... Why do they call it "Ten-Four"?		
You mean 104? Isn't it obvious? Break it into two numbers, 		
...Who thought that was a good idea?		
Hey!!! Acro! I said I want to go to Ten-Four!		
Ugh... It's a zoo in here. Are they having a sale or what?		
No, silly. Ten-Four's always like this. Ah! Omigosh! That outfit!		
Is that the line--		
You don't know how badly me and Eri-- ...... Sorry... Me and my friend		
(...Friend? The girl on her phone?)		
IT'S HEEEEEEM!		
!? Noise!?		
Hey...Over there!		
The prince looks sooo hot!		
I gotta snap a photo with my phone!		
Oh. Not Noise... Just noisy. Who is that guy?		
Eiji Oji. The Prince of Ennui? He's the latest superstar. People love		
"F Everything"? What kind of blog is that?		
Hmm? You, young man!		
Huh?		
What are you doing in Ten-Four if you can't even coordinate an		
(Who the... Sigh.) Trends?		
Yeah, you know. Like what brands are hot?		
Ah, the blessed voice of wisdom. At least one of you knows how to		
I have to! Shibuya is every girl's war zone.		
Good thing I'm not a girl...		
You should know a trendy outfit can turn a pigsty into the loveliest		
(Arrogant snob. I am not...a...a spicy tuna roll!)		
He's right, Acro. As long as we're here--		
Oh, no. Count me out. I don't care about trends. I wear what I want to		
Ugh, no, you can't do that! They call it a fashion statement for a		
(Then I wish I had more zippers...so I could tell you to ZIP IT.)		
Look, you've got potential. You could be sooo much cooler. And I KNOW		
Well, I'm not going to force you. But your clothes... They're, um...		
WHAT?		
Ahh! Nothing, nothing! Just forget I brought it up. ......		
(Suddenly, I feel naked.)		
So what's so great about trends?		
Oh! Changed your mind?		
Course not. I'm just asking.		
Well, Shibuya's kind of unique. Trends here change really quickly. And		
Better how?		
I don't need help being cool.		
I know what I'm doing, Acro. I've been studying fashion bit by bit, so 		
No kidding.		
I've always liked to sew. I started with little things like stuffed		
So the one you're always carting around-- you made that?		
Yup. The clothes I've got on, too.		
Seriously!? Wow. They look like what you'd buy in a store.		
Heh, thanks. But the clothes, I just sewed them. Eri did the design.		
(Eri? Oh. The girl from her phone.)		
I still have a lot to learn. But one day...		
So that stuffed animal is your creation.		
I...I made him a long time ago, so he's not very good.		
Why do you still have it? Stuffed animals are for kids.		
Shut up! This is my psych! How else am I gonna fight off the Noise?		
That...is your psych? ! You mean... you use that piggy as a weapon?		
He's not a pig! He's a cat! Mr. Mew the cat!		
"Mr. Mew"? (How old is she? Three?)		
Look, I only know how to use tele...whatever.		
Telekinesis? OK, but why a stuffed animal? Couldn't you pick something		
I tried. But Mr. Mew was the only thing that worked. Besides, I'm not		
Umm... That's not telekinesis.		
Hmm... I guess not.		
(The pig moves on its own? What if it's possessed-- waiting to pork-		
I know he turned out awful, but... without him, I never would've 		
So, a fashion designer, huh?		
Yup! I want to make clothes for a living. Nice clothes make people

Heh heh, I try. But I still have a ways to go. There's so much to 		
Cool. (I didn't give her enough credit. She's got a dream. That's more		
Pay attention to the trends from now on, Acro.		
......		
OK, let's head to Towa Records. Beat and Rhyme are probably waiting.		
Acro... Beat and Rhyme are waiting. Let's head over to Towa		
Why? He wanted to race. Let him wait.		
Umm... Don't you think that's a little unfair to Rhyme?		
......		
Hey, Acro... Hold up.		
What?		
When I scan, sometimes I see this weird green symbol. Wonder what it 		
Green symbol? ...... Hey, you're right. Reminds me of a pig.		
Hmm... And the pig indicator on my phone is lit. Hey! Remember? The		
You mean the Pig Noise?		
He said Pig Noise always drop pins.		
Uh-huh.		
So, like, shouldn't we go fight them? Free stuff!		
Big deal.		
Plus the pins you're wearing will get stronger from fighting. It's a		
...Right.		
Good, it's settled. Let's take those piggies out!		
...... Want past this wall? Bring me two 1,000 Yen pins. Noise No. 		
We need those pins.		
Yeah. But there's no guarantee Noise will drop them.		
Feeling lucky? We could try leveling down.		
Leveling... what?		
Here-- I found this feature on my phone.		
OK! We got the right pins. Let's have him open the wall.		
Objective met. Wall clear! [Wall goes down]		
Ahh, enough! Just looking at you makes me cringe!		
What did I do!? (What's gotten into her?)		
It's coming loose.		
Umm... (What, your grip on reality?)		
Acro... That button on your shorts.		
Oh, yeah. What does it matt--		
It matters! I can't stand things like that!		
Who care's? It's just a button.		
Off.		
What?		
Your shorts. Take them off! I'll fix the button.		
Are you high!? I'm not taking my pants off in front of you-- in the		
Oh, grow up. What, are you going commando? You're invisible! No one's		
YOU'RE watching!		
Now! Pants! Off!		
Doooooon't!!!		
There. All done! Whew, I feel much better. Loose buttons drive me 		
That was... fast... You always carry around a needle and thread?		
Of course. They come in handy. Plus I enjoy sewing. If you need

...... Want past this wall? Bring me five 500 Yen pins.		
He wants a lot of pins...		
Let's try doing some mass Noise reduction.		
Um, how does that work?		
Whew... That should be enough pins. Now he'll open the wall		
Objective met. Wall clear!		
Oh, hey! There's Beat and Rhyme.		
The hell you been, yo? This is a race! Ain't you even tryin'?		
Nope. You're on your own there.		
Ain't you angry you lost? Don't you wanna WIN?		
Don't YOU? Why did you wait for us?		
We... We was just...		
Hee hee... Beat said we should let you catch up.		
Bwaaah! Yo, Rhyme, can it!		
Aww, Beat's a big softy underneath!		
Shh...Shiki! Not you, too! I...I just wanted to see Phones squirm, 		
Uh-huh. Consider it eaten.		
Heh heh! C'mon, Rhyme. Le's bounce!		
W-wait, Beat! You're going to trip if you don't slow down!		
She's so lucky to have her best friend as a partner.		
Guess you should've teamed up with that friend in your picture.		
But... I couldn't... We're... ......		
?		
Come on. We should go.		
A trap. Rhyme pushes Beat out		
Wh-wh-what just happened!?		
Awww! There's goes my erase streak. He was supposed to be number 16.		
Reapers?		
Bingo! I'm Koki Kariya. And this is Uzuki Yashiro. There. Now that		
Hey! What did you do with Rhyme?		
Um...hello? You just saw. She's gone. Erased. Noise food. Game over.		
Her soul's just another speck of Shibuya space dust.		
No...Rhyme's gone...for good?		
You... You did this!?		
Yeah. But, like, so what? That's our JOB. Boss said set a trap, so we		
Your job? Screw your job! Murderers! You... You erased Rhyme!!! Give		
Ooh, scary. Go on, Skulls. Be the star of your little soap opera. But		
I-I didn't--		
Well, Skulls, Jr. knew. That's why she protected you. Gave her life 		
Rhyme is gone... because of me?		
Awww... Boo hoo. But don't worry. You won't suffer for long, hee hee!		
!? Noise!? You punks can make Noise?		
Bingo! All you need is some Soul and a pin to bind it to.		
We'd looove to take you on ourselves, but attacking Players directly 		
So! Our work here is done... Time to call it a day.		
Buh-bye. Nice knowing you.		
Oh, yeah. One last thing, Skulls. You want payback? Then man up, huh? 		
HEY!!! Get back here you son of a... Dontchu run from me! Dontchu run,		
Hey, we gotta get rid of this Noise.		
Yeah. Otherwise...		
Start with the smaller Noise!		
There. That just leaves the big one.		
Right!		
Dontchu touch it, yo.		
Huh?		
This one's mine. This bastard took Rhyme from me. Get in my way and		
Don't be stupid!		
Who- who's there?		
You're down a partner. How you think you're gonna take on the Noise?		
Like I care! Butt out, yo! I gotta avenge Rhyme!		
You mean waste her sacrifice! You're powerless. Accept it! Rhyme left		
Rrgh... My life's over anyway. You jus' said so.		
There's a way to keep you alive. But you have to come with me. Now!		
Why should I live when she can't, yo?		
Beat, go with him. Rhyme would want it that way.		
But--		
We'll handle this.		
She was our friend, too.		
Ahhhhhh....		
Listen. You may be alone. But there's still a role that only you can		
Grrraaaaaah!!! ...Fine. But you better kill that bastard dead. Avenge		
Well... We're alone again. Think Beat'll be OK?		
Mr. Hanekoma's with him. He's fine.		
But...he only had three minutes to live.		
So what were we supposed to do?		
I don't know... Why couldn't we save Rhyme?		
Because we couldn't. That's how it was meant to be.		
How can you just write her off like that!? Don't you care? Aren't you		
Yeah? Like what? (Dammit...I feel like crap. This is just like that		
How dare you! You think NOT teaming up would have saved her? How can		
Then who needs 'em.		
Huh?		
Who needs friends! They laugh and talk like idiots and pretend to agree		
Acro! I am your friend. So is Rhyme--		
Back off! No one's my friend. Least of all you. I just stay with you to		
Acro...How c-could you... You didn't feel anything when Rhyme was		
Erased. Chapter Closed]		
Unnh...Where am I?		
Hey. You awake? ...... The mission's not here yet. ...... Looks like		
(That I was no better than a Reaper... Rhyme... ...... Well. Right		
Yeah. You're right. For Beat.		
It's here! The mission! "Free Spain Hill from the Noise. You have 200		
Oww!		
The timer. Free it? Then we have to erase some Noise.		
Spain Hill's right over there.		
Then let's get going.		
...... Want past this wall? Then wipe out two of this area's largest		
The way to Spain Hill is blocked.		
Then let's give the guy what he wants.		
OK! The biggest Noise symbols, huh?		
OK... We did what he wanted.		
Let's have him clear the way to Spain Hill.		
...... Objective met. Wall clear! [Wall is lowered]		
So we just have to clear the Noise out of here, right?		
Let's get started.		
So many Noise.		
If that's our mission...		
I know, I know. Let's start picking them off!		
Huff...huff... This isn't working...		
We're not even making a dent. Why do more Noise keep showing up?		
You think something is drawing them here?		
If so, we'll have to strike at the source. (...Wherever that is.)		
C'mon, Ai. What's wrong?		
!! Acro. Look! Those two girls that just left the restaurant...		
Ai, are you mad at me?		
Don't be ridiculous.		
You...you sure?		
Yes! OK?		
Whoa! Look at all the Noise! What's up with those two?		
Looks like they're having an argument-- and that's drawing all the		
I think we found our source.		
OK. Let's try getting rid of the Noise around them!		
We need to take out the Noise possessing those two.		
Right!		
(They've gotta be the source of all those.)		
That takes care of those Noise.		
No... Look! Here come some more!		
Crap. This will never work.		
Those two keep drawing more in. What's their story, I wonder?		
Hey, Ai, are you free around this time next week?		
...... Probably. Why?		
N-nothing. Forget it.		
......		
Whoa, feel all that negativity?		
! What if that's attracting the Noise?		
Huh?		
Remember last time? The Noise hijacked the tech because he was jealous.		
Hey, you're right... But these two don't look possessed. They're 		
If we help them patch things up--		
The Noise will stop coming! Brilliant! Let's try it!		
First we have to figure out what's wrong...		
So... How do we help them patch things up?		
Sounds like a job for imprinting, if you ask me.		
Good idea! Let's start by hunting down some memes.		
OK! Enough self-pity. I have a job to do, and I'm going to 		
(Uhh...first, you need to do your job.)		
I'd better hunker down and check the pavement!		
...Classy.		
Where is all this merchandise coming from? First "Reaper		
? What's up with that guy?		
Reaper... Creeper...		
Is he having a stroke?		
Hmm...It looks like some kind of divination. See how he put that ten-		
You mean where HE moves it. It's not gonna move on its own.		
Unless we play a little trick. Think you could use your psychs to give		
White! Go to White!		
White! An answer, clear as day! Nothing beats Reaper Creeper 		
...Let's move on.		
Let's.		
Mina... You really didn't go to Shibu yesterday?		
I...I didn't. I swear! Quit asking, Ai.		
Sure, whatever.		
(She is so lying... ! ...Reaper Creeper? Of course! Why didn't I think of		
Hmm? What's up?		
Ever heard of "Reaper Creeper"?		
Reaper Creeper... Oh, yeah! That magic game people were talking about 		
Wanna try it?		
Sure! Sounds like fun!		
They're going to use Reaper Creeper... Acro. Should we fake it?		
Yeah... We may want to get our fact straight first.		
Hey, Ai, you sure this isn't phony?		
Very sure. I saw it move yesterday!		
OK, then. Let's give it another try.		
OK, let's move the coin and rig the answers. If we want them to patch		
Ai needs to know the truth.		
What!? But...that's really risky. Ai suspects Mina. She thinks Mina is		
Exactly. That Mina girl is lying. And Ai is gonna find out eventually		
Well... I don't know...		
Lying isn't right.		
......		
OK, Reaper Creeper has a few rules.		
Like what?		
First, someone has to summon the Reaper.		
Ooh, let me do it!		
...All right.		
Reaper...Creeper... Before we get in much deeper... If you're here all		
Go to White!		
White! Cool... The coin really moved! So, like... We said, "if you're		
That's right. And they can see right through a lie.		
Scary!		
All right, Mina. Next question.		
What are you gonna ask?		
Hmm... Why don't I ask about you?		
About m-me? Why?		
(Because I'm onto you, you tramp. You and Makoto.) Reaper...Creeper...If		
Mina has a crush on someone, doesn't she?		
Aha! White!		
Um, Ai--		
(White means YES. She's got a crush. And I saw her with him yesterday.		
Ai... This isn't like you.		
REAPER. CREEPER. If Mina has secrets that should be brought to light...go		
You're hiding something from me, aren't you!?		
Aha! See! White!		
Please...Ai!		
I knew you were hiding something!		
...What?		
This is it, Mina! Last question!		
Ai, please stop...		
REAPER. CREEPER. Yesterday Mina met with Makoto. And she LIED to me about		
! What? Ai, you knew about that? Aww... You saw us?		
Yes! I know all about you. You and Makoto and your little--		
Here.		
What... Two tickets? How could you, Mina... You knew I liked Makoto.		
I'm sorry. I just wanted to help.		
...What?		
Makoto wants to go to the Molco slam-off. But he couldn't get a ticket.		
Oh, Mina. You didn't...		
You and Makoto go have a great time.		
You got them for me?		
Yup! Now you can put the moves on him, hee hee.		
Mina... I'm so sorry... I totally got the wrong idea...		
No worries. It's partly my fault for fibbing to you. We're friends.		
...Yeah.		
Acro! The Noise are thinning out.		
Good! Let's finish the job.		
So, the Noise feed on negativity...		
Acro!		
Let's finish the last of the Noise.		
Right!		
Timer's gone.		
Whew! Mission complete. Looks like Ai and Mina made up, too.		
Hey, let me take you out to eat. It's the least I can do.		
Really? Awesome! How about sundaes?		
Sure! Let's hit that family restaurant up the street.		
OK!		
Aww... See how nice it is to have friends?		
(No.)		
Sure, you may butt heads now and then, but life is more fun that way.		
(Fun? Right. Every time you argue, you end up meeting halfway and 		
...... Acro...You don't lie to MAKE friends. I agree, that wouldn't be

Hey, Acro? Yesterday you said we were better off without friends. You

Eri used to do everything for me. There was nothing she COULDN'T do.		
I thought that pig of yours was the reason.		
He's a CAT! Ugh. Anyway... She saw me making Mr. Mew. And then she		
       "Wow, you're really good with a needle." So we got talking, and she

Meeting her, talking to her, getting to know her... Admiring her... It

Rhyme said she didn't know what dreams are like. And now she never		
I know... I...I'm sad, too. We'll just have to live a little extra. For

! Second chance?		
Hello, young lady.		
! Who's there?		
A Reaper!		
Correct. But not just any Reaper. I am Yodai Higashizawa... Game		
Game Master... So you're in charge?		
Correct again.		
Then Rhyme is gone because of you!		
I detest leftovers. No Players were meant to escape yesterday's

Because you are strong. It's a dog-eat-dog world. A logical		
How dare you! Rhyme protected Beat! You call that weak? Take it back!		
I admire your courage and loyalty, young lady. Delectable. This		
Heh heh... I see I've sunk my teeth into something good.		
We'll never lose to you! You'll pay for what you did the Rhyme!		
Sadly, I've had my fill for the day. I only came here to meet 		
Me? ...Why?		
To get a closer look, of course. At the charcoal-black envy		
I...I don't understand.		
Oh, don't you, though? You can't fool me. You know the feelings		
!?		
Oh, how deeply you must hate yourself. You have EXACTLY what you		
......		
No one loves you. You can't love yourself. And so the jealousy		
Stop it!		
That friendly sugar coating can't sweeten the selfishness inside		
No...I'm not--		
You are. And you know it. Why else would your entry fee be--		
Stop! Don't say it!		
Heh heh... That complex of yours is a bruise on the tomato of		
No, I... I'm just...		
Nothing will change if you are restored to life. You'll just go		
No... Please don't...		
Restored to life? What the hell are you talking about!?		
You're dead. Didn't you know?		
I'm... I'm dead?		
All the Players are. The Reapers' Game is an examination, to see

Now, if I may be excused... See you on Day 7. Keep it fresh. 		
I'm... I'm d-d-dead? How? When did I... I'm DEAD!?

Where...? Back at the scramble... ! What's this? A new pin? (Where'd it		
Now listen up. This Shibuya ain't your Shibuya. It's the Composer's		
So we're basically invisible?		
Only those involved in the Game can see you.		
So...the Players, The Reapers, and... you?		
Right.		
Why am I even in this stupid game?		
All Players come from the RG to the UG for a common reason. And each

The scramble crossing at three o'clock?		
Is something scheduled to happen? Or do we make it happen? Let's start		
We need to make sense of this mission.

Hmm?		
I, umm...you, uhh...		
Sota? Like, this guy. He's, like, talking to me?		
Wha--		
Scuse me?		
Uh-oh...		
Whadda you want, dawg? Got somethin' to say to my Nao?		
Like, he said he thinks I'm cute... Right?		
Wr-wrong! I don't think that at all!		
What? You don't?		
Scuse me?		
Ahhh! No no no no, she's cute! But not...you know...ahhh!

Whoa! Really?		
What's your name?		
It's... Makoto Miki. Friends call me Mick.		
Mick... You're a good man.		
Yeah! Like, that was totally moving?		
Handing out pins for your grandpa in the scramble... That's aces, dawg.		
Like, I think I'm in love?		
We'll wear your pins. It'd be an honor.		
Th-thanks!		
Hang in there, Mick. We'll be rootin' for you.		
Hope your granddaddy, like, cheers up?		
Who? Oh! M-me too... Wow, I'm on fire today! OK! Time to hand these 		
Looks like it worked.		
You really think a pin like this could take off?		
It better. That's our mission.		
...Yeah.		
What a handful, huh?		
He headed down Center Street...		
Then we should follow. The guy's a PR time bomb.		
...... Like a bolt from the blue, it's time for the Reaper Review. 		
Oh ho! Question 2! What's on the sign outside the Shibu Dept. Store?		
...I see, I see! Question 3! Bigbanfrog is No. 2 on the Noise Report.

Bzzzt! So sorry! I can't let you pass-- until you pass.		
...... Did you do your homework, kids? Then away we go!		
OK! This seems like a good spot.		
Here we go again...		
......		
I think he could use a little help.		
Ooh! That kid's sure to take one. Hey, there, slugger.		
WHOAAA!		
Huh?		
Lemme guess, bro. You want me to make you one of my Slammurai...		
Uh... I didn't--		
Don't be shy! It's cool! SLAM ON!!!		
No. I'm not here to--		
What's your favorite whammy?		
Buh--		
What are you ranked?		
I...I... I don't know!		
(Who...who is this kid!?)		
! Unreal, bro!		
WHOAAA!!!		
Huh?		
What's that pin?		
Oh, this?		
Yeah! Tell me where you got it!		
Well--		
What's it's Attack?		
Uhh... unreal, bro?		
Seriously? How about it's Defense?		
Unreal, bro!		
Whoa! BRO!!! You and me gotta battle. I want that pin!		
Huh?		
Ready? Slaaam... ON!		
Woo... hoooooo! I won, bro! Better practice up. Rely on pins 		
Huh? But... OK... It worked!		
And he does this for a living? C'mon. I saw him run up past

...... Want past this wall? Bring me three Rare Metal pins. Noise No.		
Three Rare Metals.

(Wait-- the Noise Report! Quick, check your phone.)		
Got the pins we need... Now to clear the wall and find our		
Objective met. Wall clear!		
That guy... He's gone. (Where'd he run off to?)		
OK! This seems like a good spot.		
Here we go again...		
......		
Pardon me. Hello? Excuse me! ...... Can't he hear me? What now?		
(Think, Mick!)		
! Come get some hot stuff!		
!		
No good? Hot stuff! Come get some!		
!		
Huh? I think I got a reaction that time. One more time!		
(Feel it, Makoto! You're so close! You saw him react! Now,		
! Come get some hot stuff!

Oh! Hot stuff!		
Ooh! Hot!		
Yeah, hot stuff!		
Come get some!		
...I'll take one.		
Oh. Thank you! Finally! All done. Now these pins are sure to take		
So far so good. Let's follow him back to the scramble.		
......		
Now, to witness a phenomenon in the making! I bet I'll have to BEAT		
Oh, come on. Handing out a few pins isn't going to ignite Shibuya. We		
...... Just... give it up.		
Huh?		
Even if we do clear the mission... I'll still... I'll never be...		
!? Hey! What's gotten into you?		
(What's gotten into her? That Reaper yesterday must have		
(I can't just leave her by herself...)		
Hey, what gives?		
......		
You've been acting really weird today.		
......		
It's almost 3. We need to get moving, or we'll fail the mission.		
...So what?		
Huh?		
There's no point. You heard what that Reaper said. ...... Even if I		
What kind of question is that?		
...... I thought I'd changed. But I'll never change. I'll just go on		
Says who?		
...... I was never pretty... or smart... There was nothing special		
......		
But it didn't work.		
I don't-- !? WHOA! Over there! Is that... you?		
Ahh!		
The other day, I found just the cutest outfit at Ten-Four!		
Seriously? Hey, why don't we head over there? You've still go some 		
Eri? What the...		
...... [leaves]		
Hey! Wait!		
Two Stalkers? ...... (I better go see what's wrong...)		
So now you know.		
Know what?		
...... What my entry fee was.		
Huh?		
My appearance. I gave up the way I really look.		
Your appearance? Then--		
This is Eri's body. I don't really look like this.		
Oh. Wow...		
When I got to the UG and I saw myself... I freaked.		
Yeah. I would, too.		
But it was a happy kind of freaked.		
Happy? Why?		
Because this is what I always dreamed of-- a new me. I hated who I		
...... Then why would the Reapers take your appearance? Your entry fee		
At first... I didn't get it either. I was so excited to be Eri that I		
......		
Eri has all the things I don't. Looks, brains, design sense. Lots of

The truth is, I'm scared! I keep trying to sound brave, saying we need		
Well... I like you the way you are.		
Huh?		
Noooooo!		
What the--		
No one's wearing the pins! Why not!?		
Looks like we can't relax yet. Listen. We're going to finish this		
...... All right.		
You'd think he'd realize giving away a few freebies isn't		
Seriously.		
But we can't give up now.		
...Uh-huh.		
Let's see what he does next.		
That guy by the scramble is asking for trouble... We should		
...Uh-huh.		
Why isn't anyone talking about the pins? I worked so hard...		
Hey, Mick.		
Huh? Oh! Mr. Oji. Prince...		
I saw you standing here. Why so glum?		
It's work. I'm going to lose my job. I was supposed to make these		
Aw, Mick, you can't be serious.		
What?		
All right, listen. You've done good business for me, so I'll give it 		
Hmm. True... So then how do I change the trends?		
Lots of ways. I mean, if you were a Prince like me, just walking the		
If people saw you wearing the pin... Right...		
OK. I've gotta run. Press date. Take care, Mick. You can do it.		
Thanks! I'll try! Hmm... Trends, eh? OK! If the Prince can do it, so		
This guy is certifiable...		
...But think about it. Acro, if you put the pin on and we fought some		
How do you figure?		
Rhyme and I got to talking. We noticed wearing pins in combat makes		
Even though the RG people can't see us?		
Yeah. Weird, huh?		
All right... Let's give it a try.		
So wearing the red pin into combat will make it popular?		
Uh-huh. But it may take a few battles.		
All right. Here goes...		
We have to make that red pin popular.		
Uh-huh.		
Let's start in the scramble.		
Hey! Isn't that pin the coolest?		
Huh? Where?		
There. The one that guy's got on.		
Oh yeah! Very nice. Wonder where they sell 'em.		
Whoa... People keep looking at me and smiling. Am I... I couldn't		
It worked.		
So the pins we wear in combat do change what's popular in the RG.		
Uh-huh. But that guy seems to have his own theory.		
Get ready, 104! Your trend-god cometh!		
...... He's kind of a tool, huh?		
Next stop: 104!		
OK! Time to look trendy!		
Yeah, with a little help.		
We need to reshape the trends here, too.		
Let's do some fighting, then.		
Hey, check out that hot pin!		
Yeah. The one on that guy? People were wearing it back at		
Seriously? It's gonna be huge, just wait and see.		
Wish I had one...		
Whoa... I get it. I really get it! The trends are mine to command!		
Well, we did it.		
Did we?		
Hey, we gave it our best shot. Let's just cross our fingers.		
...... Acro... Umm... I'm sorry. If we fail, and it turns out to be my		
...... No big deal. We all, umm...		
Hmm?		
We all have our bad days.		
Acro... Thanks.		
! Hey, it's her.		
!? Ahh!		
So, Eri. How come you haven't designed anything lately?		
...... Actually... I'm thinking about giving it up.		
What! Why? You're so talented!		
She's giving it up? Eri, why... ......		
If you want to know, scan her.		
What? I can't do that! She's my friend. I can't eavesdrop on her		
Why not? You've scanned tons of people.		
......		
Eri, why would you give design up?		
......		
Well, there was this girl, Shiki--		
!? Acro... I have to go!		
Hey! Just...wait!		
I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't want to hear Eri talk about me. I was

Eri told me something before I died. "You're not meant to be a

Huh?		
You're you. You're not Eri. You'll never be Eri. You'll only ever be		
But she's so much better--		
Forget her! You need to live your own life. If she can do it, so can 		
...... Acro--		
You're lucky you're jealous. It gives you something to shoot for. So...		
...... You're right. Thanks, Acro.		
It's time. The commercial's about to air.		
Sooo nervous... Will people watch?		
Acro...		
Don't worry. They'll watch.		
Hey! Up there!		
That pin. Who designed it? It looks like--		
Hey, cool graphic.		
I never wear pins. But this one...		
Where can I buy it?		
Hey, man, look what I got.		
You HAVE one? Aw, lucky...		
Oh, I know that pin!		
Ha ha. You would, Eri. Wish I had one...		
Eri... ...... Acro, can I have a minute? I want to go stand by her.		
Hey, you're off the clock.		
...Thanks!		
Eri, you shouldn't give up design.		
I told you. This girl, Shiki-- I'm nothing without her.		
Huh?		
Yeah, you said that. What, did you two have a fight?		
A fight? I wish. Shiki died. In an accident the other day.		
Oh... I'm so sorry.		
No one else could ever make my outfits. Shiki gave them life. Made them		
You must have trusted her a lot.		
I did! She was an amazing person. She cared about people-- and always		
The way you talk about her, she must have been something.		
...... The day before her accident... I said something I'll always		
What?		
She was upset 'cause she couldn't come up with a good design. I wanted		
...... I had no idea. I never knew she felt that way about me.		
Guess you two both need each other.		
Acro... You think I'm OK the way I am?		
Hey, Shibuya's got room for all types. Who else is gonna make stuffed		
He's a cat! Heh heh... Acro... I want to see Eri again. So we can be a

Yup. Today we win this.		
! There it is!		
The last mission.		
"The Game Master awaits you on the freeway. Defeat him. You have 600		
Oww! The Game Master is that big Reaper, right?		
We need to pay him back for Rhyme.		
Yeah... C'mon. We've got a Game to win. For Beat... and for us!		
! Who could be calling us now?		
Think it's the Reapers?		
Hello? Dead kid speaking.		
Phones! That you?		
Mr. Hanekoma?		
Listen! Beat, he... he's gone!		
Gone!? You don't mean...		
No, no...Not erased. ...Not yet.		
What's that supposed to mean?		
Look, he musta left the caf       		
He left? Why!?		
I dunno why. Look, enough questions. You gotta hurry! That kid ain't 		
Son of a--		
Hey, hey, have a little faith. You're almost there! Just put an end to		
Right, got it.		
Acro, what's going on? Is Beat in trouble?		
Yeah... But we can save him if we end the Game in time.		
Then let's move it!		
(That meathead! Has he lost his mind!? Why couldn't he just stay with		
Acro! Let's got over to the freeway! It's not far from the station		
Let's book it to the freeway.		
OK. It's past Hachiko!		
...... Want past this wall? Then fight through a three-reduction		
Three rounds, huh? Ready to chain some battles?		
Whenever you are!		
There! That makes three.		
Let's clear the wall and head for the freeway!		
...... Objective met. Wall clear! [wall goes down]		
Clear!		
Go, go, go!		
The freeway's just ahead. Through the underpass!		
Six days you're still kickin'. I'm impressed.		
A Reaper...		
Hey, clear the road! We're in a hurry!		
Oh, I'll clear the road-- of YOU, that is.		
Hey hey... Don't run off.		
!?		
Where's the love, guys?		
A Reaper...		
Move! We're in a hurry!		
Six days you're still kickin'. I'm impressed.		
I said MOVE!		
Aww, sorry. No dice. It's a race to erase, and I aim to		
Dammit...That cost us time.		
I hope Beat's OK.		
Worrying won't save him. C'mon. We're still in this.		
Right! Let's shut their Game down!		
Bleh. Day 7 is such a yawn. Not enough Players left, you know?		
See? This is why I pace myself. Work too hard and you run out of		
Yeah... We did rack up a ton of points this week.		
And on the seventh day... we rest. The first day of many days off, I		
Yo...		
! Who's there? ...You!?		
......		
We toasted your partner-- you should be smoke by now!		
Make another pact?		
......		
So, like, what? You thirsty for revenge?		
No!		
...Huh? Then what do you want?		
...... Answers. Tell me what I need to know!		
You do realize... you're in no position to make demands?		
......		
I could erase you with my little finger.		
......		
Aight, Skulls... You ask. Maybe we'll answer.		
Hey... Kariya!!!		
What does it take? How do you Reapers do it!?		
Game Master's just ahead...		
Finally...the end is in sight. It's been crazy, huh? Our time in the 		
...... The best is still ahead. Once we win, and come back to life.		
Yeah! Acro... Thanks for these last seven days. You're pretty good at		
Pfft... Save it for when we win, OK? ...Ready for the big boss?		
You know it. Hey, if we make it through this... let's meet up in the 		
I'll...think it over.		
Heh heh. OK. Let's finish this!		
You're late. A shame I had to set the table before cooking the		
We're not on the menu. You are!		
Ah, hello there, young lady. I've been waiting for this day. !?		
Lost your appetite?		
But...you were green with envy! Begrudging to a light golden		
That's right. I was jealous. That's how lucky I am! It takes an		
You tell him!		
I swear I'm getting my life back! Eri's waiting in the RG, and you...		
...... You're gone stale, young lady. But no matter. A true chef		
...... In...indigestible! I lost? Well done... young lady...		
Game over.		
That's it?		
We did it! We won!		
Woo-hoo! Now we'll come back to life!		
!? Wh-what's going on?		
!? Shiki?		
Huh? I don't think this light is bad.		
Yeah... Feels almost like a...pat on the back.		
A warm welcome back to the world of living! And you said "Shiki"!		
Oh, really?		
Acro? See you on the other side. You know the meeting place. Hachiko!		
Heh. It's a date.		
Why... Why, why, why...		
...... WHYYYYYY!

There's the timer... The mission format's different. X=30+74... They're		
Ugh. It's like a sick joke. They expect us to work this week, too?		
Oh, suck it up! Don't you want the extra points? Though it is a little		
Not quite a first. Been a while, though. You prob'ly weren't here,

Yashiro here. ...... What!? You want us to WHAT!?

Easy, girl! What's the deal?		
Standby! We're just supposed to sit here! This is an insult!

Ugh! This is why I hate the way he runs things!		
Really? I kinda like it.		
What's to like!? It's one big, cryptic mess! It pisses me off!		
He can't help it. I'm sure he's worked out some crazy plan--		
(Come on... There has to be someone! I need this... I have to win!		
A pact? With who!?		
Howdy.		
(Who the--)		
The name's Yoshiya Kiryu. But Mother and Father call me Souvik.		
(Please don't tell me...)		
I guess you can call me Souvik, too-- seeing as how you're my dear,		
Your what!? (This pipsqueak is my new partner!?)		
You seem like such a pro at this, I just... helped myself.		
A pro? How could you know that?		
I've been watching you, silly. Very impressive by the way.

Today's the first day and all... Let's just take it easy, hmm? Why		
F-fine. (Something about him just...grates.)		
What's wrong? Don't tell me you've forgotten how to scan?		
Look, I... I know, OK? (Ugh! Smug little...)		
Going somewhere? Step one is to collect some info. Give the

Will you? Wonderful. Then can we go?		
(Something's weird here... How was I able to scan him? He's a Player.)		
Hmm? What's the holdup, Acro?		
It's nothing.		
Don't tell me you're still stuck on the mission mail. Please. It's

Acro, hmm? Hee hee... Charming.		
(Gaaah!)		
Well then, Acro. Shall we?		
Is there a problem, Acro? Forget where we're going already?		
I remember! 104, geez.		
Hee hee. Then let's go, hmm?		
Want to clear this wall? Then take down these Noise!		
Another wall...		
So we need to clear out a few Noise to get by. All right. What better

Put simply, I play things high or low.		
High or low?		
You should be able to pick it up on the fly. Ready for a little

Objective met. Wall clear!		
Timer's gone... We're safe. That's one day down...		
! Acro... What do you suppose that is?		
What the hell? That junk heap wasn't here before!		
You're zetta slow!		
What!? Who said that?		
Don't look at me. Look at your junk heap there.		
There's somebody up there?		
I said, you're zetta slow! How long does it take to crack a Z-		
Hecto-what?		
Nngh! My...head!		
Sho Minamimoto. Remember the name. I'm the new Game Master.		
Then you're a Reaper.		
! Wait. You... You're a Player this time around?		
Nngh, who... me?		
Hmph. Now that's a happy miscalculation. This brings me one		
Solution? ...Nngh! What are you talking about?		
Hee hee... Day 1, and the GM's already putting in an appearance? Not

Precisely! You 000s have no value here. So! Now that I have you		
Whew... Well, so much for Day 1.		
(That Reaper knew me... How?)		
Rather fascinating, wasn't he?		
Uhh...		
At least we won't be too bored this week, hmm?		
(This kid, too... There's something seriously not right about him.)		
I wonder what the little math fetishist will think up for tomorrow.		
(Hmph. He's shady... Still, "trust your partner," right? I need him if

Nope. No luck. This one's not opening either.		
Well, thanks anyway. You're dismissed. He's sealed off Route 1... 		
Hey, Kariya!		
Any luck?		
Routes 2, 5, and 6 are all sealed.		
Gotta hand it to him, the guy works fast.		
He could have told us what areas are open. What the hell is he

Say, Acro. I have a little proposal.		
...What?		
Let's play hooky today. Forget about the mission.		
What!? Are you crazy? If we don't do this, we get erased!		
But there's someplace I reeeally want to go. Let the other Players		
Yes, we do! I can't afford to screw around on this! I'm not letting

I'm not just playing this for me anymore! Her life is on the line, too.		
...Where are we?		
It's too bright... I can't see a thing.		
Yo...		
Beat! You're safe!		
Yeah. You too, huh?		
......		
Why'd you run off on your own like that? You had us all so worried!		
I...I jus' had to... Look, yo... my bad. I jus' had to take off.		
......		
So... Are we...alive again?		
I'm afraid not. Not yet, anyway.		
Who's there!?		
Hello, and congratulations. You all are victors. How did you find our

What did you say?		
But that's... that's cruel! I thought everyone got to come back!		
Any and all specifics are decided by the Composer. That is His

Not exactly what?		
Not everybody... I... ...... I ain't goin' back.

...... Very well. Your wish is within my authority to grant. The

Beat! Why!?		
......		
Hey, wait! BEAT!		
Why would Beat want to join the Reapers?		
......		
The hour of reckoning draws near. Your points have been tallied, and		
!? M-me!? But... I can't... I'm not going back alone-- I can't! It's		
We grade Players according to their performance during the missions.		
But that can't be right! Acro is way better with psychs than me! And		
...... If only one of us gets a second chance... what happens to the		
If you still cling to life, you may reenter the Game. If you lean		
...... Shiki... You go on ahead.		
No way!		
Just go! Trust me.		
I'm not leaving without you, Acro! I'll enter the Game again. Let 		
Out of the question. As I mentioned a moment ago. This was decided by		
No way...		
Shiki... Don't worry about me.		
But Acro--		
Didn't you swear you'd go back and see Eri again?		
......		
I still don't even know how I died. I don't know if I have anything to		
Acro...		
You're not gonna start slipping back now, are you?		
Huh?		
Back to the old Shiki.		
N-no... ...... I'm so sorry, Acro. Thank you. I'll go back-- back to 		
There you go.		
I'll be waiting for you-- every day, in front of Hachiko...till you 		
I'll see you there soon. That's a promise.		
Finished your goodbyes, then?		
!? Acro!		
Once you see the real me, will we still be friends?		
Count on it. You'll always be Shiki.		
Shiki...		
And now it's your turn. You seem to have your mind made up.		
Damn straight. I'll play your Game again.		
Excellent. No doubt you'll make it an exciting one. Then before the		
Nnnnnngh!!! Huff...huff... What... What the hell did you just do to		
I simply returned to you what is yours. Fair is fair.		
Nngh, I get it now... This explains a lot. My memory... was gone...		
Indeed. Memories are the single greatest determinant of a person's		
!? Hey... Wait just a... Where's the rest!?		
Beg pardon?		
It's missing! How did I die!? I still can't remember anything about my		
Oh really? Most fascinating...		
Cut the crap! You're the one who...		
HOWEVER. That has nothing to do with the Game.		
What!?		
I returned your memory in its entirety. If you still can't recall		
I never...?		
What could I possibly stand to gain from depriving you of that		
(...He's right. So why is that the only hole in my memory?)		
Now then. As for your new entry fee--		
You're taking my memory again!?		
A Player's entry fee is that which they hold most dear. That is the		
What!?		
This time, you're playing for... Shiki Misaki.		
WHAT!? That's not... NOOOOO!		
I...		
......		
I got her dragged back into this. But I'll be damned if I let it end		
...... Hmph.		
! "Hmph," what!? Weren't you listening?		
Uh-huh. And here's me playing the world's tiniest violin.		
You little... I just--		
Did you think you were special? Every Player here put up something		
Sacrifices? Are you... (No. Gotta calm down. Losing it here will only		
...... Oh, I suppose. You'll just owe me one.		
(Owe you one what!? You're a Player! Clearing the mission HELPS you!		
You have yourself a deal, Acro. So? What's the mission?		
"Game II: Acquire the v3 Au pin. "t = 300 min. Incompletes will be		
Nngh... Clock's ticking. So what's up with this mission? It's		
We know it has something to do with a pin. Any thoughts beyond that,		
Au...The periodic symbol for gold? A pin made of gold, maybe?		
Hmm... Not a bad hypothesis. Let's go with that for now. What about		
v3... Well, the square root of 3 is 1.7320508. Some kind of entry code?		
Ooh, a tantalizing possibility, Acro! I'm so proud.		
(...Bite me.)		
But I think it's referring to a street here in Shibuya.		
A street?		
The Reapers use numbers to refer to each of Shibuya's streets. Route		
(How does HE know that? And why go asking me-- to make me look stupid?)		
So let's check out Route 3.		
Which is?		
The road leading from Cadoi City to Molco. Shall we?		
(He knows too much. About the Reapers' Game and about my death... He's		
(...... He knows something.)		
...Hmm? Keep staring and you'll make me blush. Route 3 runs		
I heard you. Let's go.		
Yes, sir!		
I'm out of time. Even if I practice from now till the		
What did Makoto want? He said it was important.		
...... Want past this wall? Erase all the Noise possessing people in		
Eliminate the Noise possessing people here...		
Well, they usually target folks who are negative. ......		
Wh-what!?		
Oh, nothing. ...I just hate negative people, don't you?		
(Yeah, and you're just a bundle of joy. Look, let's just kill

Dammit. He must have caught me filching his fried

Right... I can do this. If I'm gonna play, I'm going for gold!

"Going for gold"?		
Of course! This is it!		
Certainly seems that way. It's a safe guess that our mission is to		
All right, then we'd better get over to Molco.		
Well, no more negative people around here... Nope, not a 		
OK, OK. Let's go.		
Hee hee.		
...... Objective met. Wall clear!		
Huff...huff...		
Still alive over there?		
Barely... What the heck was that thing?		
A Noise that targets Reapers.		
Well, duh! But that's... It's impossible!		
Somebody must have cooked some up. A fresh, steamy batch of Taboo		
What!? But that's a capital offense!		
Do I smell another game? First one to find out who's behind this--		
Kariya! This is no time for your stupid games! I'm calling		
Why the hurry, Acro? Molco's just a few blocks away. We've		
You never know what'll happen. Let's get this done.		
OK, OK...		
C'mon, already! Get a move on!		
Sigh... I don't do the whole sweating thing, Acro.		
!?		
Wha-- Are those Noise!?		
Black Noise? They look different than the usual riffraff.		
So what's the plan?		
I doubt we'd make it if we tried to run.		
Then we take 'em out!		
What the hell were those? I've never seen black Noise.		
Likewise.		
Bastards were tough, huh?		
Not only that... I couldn't really hurt them unless I had the light		
Huh? ...Really? (Wow... Maybe this kid does have his uses--)		
Hmm? Don't tell me you didn't notice, Acro. That doesn't inspire much		
(--even if he is a snot.)		
In any case, why did it pick a fight?		
Yeah... Our pact should prevent that.		
How bizarre...		
We don't have time to screw around. Let's get to Molco and		
Yes, sir!		
This is it. They're holding the slam-off inside the store.		
Dude, it's a Tin Pin slam-off! Those always rock.		
Looks like a popular event.		
(...And I've got to win it.) Let's go.		
So this is Tin Pin Slammer... All I need to do is figure out some way		
Good luck with that. At least there's a Reaper decal here. You won't		
The decal makes us visible, right?		
Yup. Every shop licensed to sell to Players has one.		
I'm not complaining, but... why let us shop at all? The Reapers want us		
Hmm... Does it really matter? Shopping is fun. The Game's better this		
(Yeah, 'cause the Game's all about fun...)		
If you don't hurry, you'll miss registration, Acro.		
OK, OK, I'm going. (Going...to do what? I've never played Tin Pin 		
(So... How do you even play this game?) Do you know how to play Tin Pin		
Who? Me? Don't be silly. I don't have a clue. Good thing I'm not		
What!?		
I thought you were going to clear this mission, Acro?		
...... (I shouldn't have bothered asking. So who DO I ask?) Gah! What		
SORRY! I wasn't watching where I was going! Hmm? Hey, you've got 		
Um, yes?		
So you're entering the slam-off?		
That's right! Losing's not an option. ...For Acro.		
(But you're cool with the idea!?)		
So, if you're not losing, then-- Wait, you're going for FIRST?		
Wh-what's wrong with my pins?		
Is this, like, your first time EVER or something? Forget about the		
(The kid's sure blunt enough.)		
I take it you're playing today, uh...		
Shuto Dan. Call me Shooter! And yeah! I'm actually kinda famous		
Wow, Shooter. You must be a real expert. Are there any tips you could		
(Thanks a lot, partner!)		
Come on, Acro, what do we say?		
Rrgh. ...Please?		
Well, you do look pretty hopeless... OK, bro! Tin Pin's a battle		
Between...souls.		
Yeah, bro! It's like your fiery passion slams into the other guy's,		
Hee hee. Sounds like a fun time.		
...... Think you could be a little more specific?		
Just a sec! I'll draw it out clear and easy for you!		
Here! THIS is Tin Pin Slammer!		
...... (It hurts to look...)		
My, my. Then there's quite a bit of depth to it.		
Right!? The timing right here is super important!		
This is practically a map to victory, huh, Acro?		
......		
Acro? Do you still not get it?		
What!? You need MORE explanation!? Aww, man! OK, fine... Let's SLAM!		
What, right now!?		
Heh heh! You've got pretty good form, bro.		
Whoa! Y-you're a fast learner.		
(So I just need to knock the other guy's pins off...)		
All clear now? Wanna slam again?		
OK! On your mark... Get set... SLAM!!!		
NICE!!! You picked it up pretty good!		
(I kinda, sorta get it...)		
Every pin's got its own stats, so try a buncha stuff out! Keep in		
(The ones I'm wearing?) So I can't play if I'm not wearing any pins?		
NAW, BRO! That's totally cool, too! You can borrow special slamming		
Thanks, but... no.		
WHOA! Look at the time! See ya! Good luck!		
Things are rrreally heating up, folks! It's time for ourrr next		
(Bring it!)		
In the red corner, the comeback kid comes back! Slams down curry		
Heh heh... I hand-design and build all my pin mods. It's Yammer Time!		
Players, on your marks... Get set...SLAM!!!		
Yes!		
WOW!!! Your first time playing, and you (dun dun DAAAH!) totally 		
Very impressive, Acro. Show those fifth graders who's boss.		
(Thanks for killing my high, man.)		
Too bad next round, though.		
Huh?		
You're facing the TOP SEED, man. You're history.		
Top seed?		
That means crazy insane strong. Dumb luck won't get you through the		
(Dumb luck? I mean, sure, I'm not exactly a pro, but... Hmm, I should		
Hee hee. Well, I'll be waiting in the stands, Acro. Do your best,		
(Damn right I will. This is important.)		
The air is electric here in the slam mall! Next up, the main 		
(Who wants some?)		
In the red corner, the top seed and Slammurai legend...		
(I don't care who he is. I have to win.)		
Shuto Daaaan!		
Him!?		
HEY, MAN! I'm impressed you got this far! Sorry, but I can't let you		
I'm up against this kid? Ugh... (Well, if this is what it takes...)		
Taste the rage of my Red Kaiser! Innn... PINCIBLE!		
Gah! It...it's over. I lost?		
You seemed pretty tough, bro! I had to get serious!		
And just like that, the match is over! Shooter does it again! The		
Watch out, Shibuya! When I'm on, I am ON!!! Woo! Time for the final		
There is no next time! Shiki... I'm sorry, I--		
Aww, what a shame. Not that I'm shocked. You're a Tin Pin virgin. 		
Don't you see what this means!? We failed! We screwed up the mission!		
You sure did. But relax...		
Relax!? How can--		
Uh-oh! Looks like trouble for our champ!		
What happened?		
What indeed? Sounds like an upset.		
Let's check it out.		
My pin... It won't eject! No, Red Kaiser! NOOO!		
It looks like a freak malfunction has cost the top seed the		
Oh, my! Looks like Shooter lost.		
! Huh? The timer's gone. Wait... We cleared the mission?		
The guy who just won is a Player, too.		
What?		
So, like, where'd the timer go?		
Mission accomplished! We did it, Nao!		
I thought you knew, Acro? It doesn't matter which Player clears the		
Whew... We're safe.		
So that's, like, another day down?		
Hope tomorrow's this easy, too!		
Wait up, man! I want a... rematch... Huh? Where'd he go? You can't

I borrowed your opponents' pins and swapped in a few of my own. Of

You're... You're devious!		
Oh, come on. You wanted to win. Wasn't that the whole reason for

Hee hee... Don't you think it's more fun with a little suspense?		
No.		
Besides, you might've won anyway. I didn't want to hurt your 		
You smug little... Is this fun for you? I'm not your toy!		
If you're done, it's my turn now.		
For what!?		
I've got an errand to run, and you're coming along.		
I just said I'm not your--		
You agreed to this, Acro. After the mission, we do what I want.		
Rrgh! ...Fine.		
Good. Then let's head back to the scramble.		
What, you're just going to ignore me? You half-blind 		
!? Hecto...Ugh.		
Nngh! Not again... My head's... pounding...		
Oh, look. It's a stray Reaper. You seem even grouchier than usual.		
Damn right! That game was zetta dull! Are you trying to bore me		
Wow, you sat there watching the entire mission? Do GMs always have 		
No comments from the peanut gallery. Your opinions are garbage!		
Hee hee... I figured you weren't much for criticism. Otherwise, why		
Heh. Even inch of my work is flawlessly calculated. Look at the		
Gee, I wonder.

(Finally... The pounding's stopped. What language is that guy		
Think he's got a thing for you, Acro?		
What!? How the hell do you figure that?		
Oh, please! The way he follows you around?		
That's just because I'm a Player.		
I don't see him chasing after the other Players.		
(He's right... So why me?)		
...Or is it my fault?		
(What? That's right... He might be tied in with the Reapers. If he is,		
...Destroy the ones you called friends. Those are your orders.		
I gotta follow orders?		
Of course. We require proof of your loyalty to the Reapers.		
Aight, yo, don't get your panties in a twist. I'm a Reaper. I'll do it.		
I trust that you will.		
I swear... ...... I'ma do this! I didn't join up for nothin'.

Where...? (The scramble again? And Souvik? ...He's on the phone again.)		
Yup... I'll be there today. You'll have it all ready for me, won't 		
(Who's he talking to? Same person as yesterday?) ...... (Well, 		
Say, Acro.		
(...That smile makes me nervous. What are you scheming now?) Yeees?		
You're coming with me today, right? There's someplace I'd like to go.

You never followed through on your promise yesterday. So today, 		
No way! I told you yesterday-- first, we do the mission. Then you can		
! Whoa, you're right. There it is, Acro! Let's see... "Proceed to Cat		
15 minutes."		
Fifteen minutes!? That's on the other side of Shibuya!		
We'd better hurry, then.		
No joke! Shut up and start running! Come on!		
Yes, sir!		
We've only got fifteen minutes! We better haul ass!		
Definitely. For Cat Street, we'd want Route 2. From here to		
Say, Acro. Hate to bother you when you're in a hurry, but--		
What do you want!? Just run!		
If we're going to Cat Street, it's a lot faster to go past

You seemed to know where you were going. I figured you had

Ugh! Not one of THEM?		
Looks like there's a wall up ahead.		
Dammit, we don't have time for this! (...There's only one way to Cat

Hmm, sure does. Wonder what today's challenge will be.		
...... Want past this wall? Then beat three of these-- where I can

Three of the Noise symbols he showed us, right?		
Right. Let's do it!		
Whew...		
Done! That should take care of the wall.		
...... Objective met. Wall clear!		
All right! Let's sprint from here!		
Oh, dear... Feeling energetic today, isn't he?		
You run, too!

Kinda, yeah. I'm surprised it worked this well.		
You...UGH! I can't believe you!		
Oh, come on. No harm done. It's not like we have a real mission yet.

Augh! You must love jerking people around.		
There there, Acro. Just be grateful this wasn't a real		
Hey, I... Why are you doing this!?		
I felt like coffee. Cat Street has a lovely caf

Heyyy! I was waiting for ya, Josh.		
Mr. Hanekoma!?		
Hmm? Oh, Phones! What, you're in the Game again?		
Yeah... And because of that, Shiki's... She was my entry fee.		
They took the young lady, huh... Well, buck up. Nothin' you can do

Sure thing, J. Lemme see your phones.		
Yours too, Acro.		
My phone? What do you need with it?		
Just doing a little upgrade.		
More features the better, right? Gimme just a sec, guys.		
I told him we were coming, so it shouldn't take long.		
Told him how? Wait, so you the person you were talking to on the phone		
Mr. H, of course.		
(Man, now I feel like an idiot. Mr. Hanekoma's got his secrets, but 		
Sorry for the wait, guys. Here ya go.		
Thanks. Now we can finally go on a little hunt.		
A hunt? For what?		
You'll see when we find it. Let's step out front and give the tracker		
Hmm, no response around here.		
......(Just what is this tracker tracking? )		
Ready to go, Acro? We'll canvass Shibuya and look for signals.		
(Should I really go along with this?)		
What's up, Phones? You look like ya got something on your mind.		
So this is your place?		
Yup! I call it "WildKat." Pretty hip, right?		
Yeah... (It's a nice enough looking place, but... nobody's here. How's

Yeah. He sees things.		
Things? Like what? "I see dead people," kind of sees things?		
Pretty much. That's how he knew about the Game. He saw Players and

Whatever you call it. So...what, it picks up some kind of signal?		
Pretty much. I set both your phones to locate energy spikes now. The		
What exactly is an energy spike?		
You can ask Josh what you guys are looking for.		
...... (Not if I want a straight answer.)		
There's one other feature in there now, too.

I told Josh how to use it. Ask him.

"Enjoy every moment with all you've got." That's the motto of the one

Are you kidding? I'm stuck in the Reapers' Game. I can't even leave		
That's for you to figure out.		
(Expand my world...)		
Now go on! Git!		
...So. What are we looking for with that thing?		
Hee hee... What, indeed? We'll know it when we see it, 		
(Gee, thanks for confiding!)		
Found ya!		
Who's there!?		
Get ready to hurt, Phones! You gonna bleed today, yo!		
Beat... You're OK!		
Better'n OK. See for yourself.		
!? You've got...wings!		
Pretty badass, huh? Proves I'm a Reaper, yo.		
A Reaper... You really joined them?		
Acro, you have Reaper friends, too? My, my. You certainly do get		
He ain't no friend a' mine. I only came here to erase you punks.		
What? You don't really--		
Yo, you hear what I said? Bring it!		
He's...strong...		
Pfft! That it? Your psychs is limp, yo! I was hopin' for a real fight,		
Hey, wait!		
Ugh, talk about your delinquent Reapers. A direct attack on Players		
Then he's really my enemy now...		
If not, he could've fooled me. He wasn't pulling any punches, Acro.		
(But why would he join the Reapers?)		
I should be careful, hanging out with you. If that was a friend, I'd		
So how do you use that thing?		
Well, we just walk around with it. It'll tell us when it		
Hold it! Acro, we're getting a response!		
A response?		
It means we're close. It's got to be around here.		
Around here where?		
I don't know... I need to pinpoint this. Let's keep looking around.		
Well?		
Hmm... It's coming through. Let's look for a stronger

? Hmm?		
What, pick something up?		
Yeah... That.		
What's up with the line?		
Let's go take a look.		
H-hey! Wait up! What are we even looking for?		
Sigh...		
Well, Acro? That ramen shop seems to be the source. Let's		
Is this a ramen shop?		
Looks pretty new. My phone says this is the place.		
Here?		
Hey! No cutting! Boys, boys, boys... You need to wait in line, same 		
Uhh, guess we're waiting outside, then.		
That's no good...		
! Wait... We're invisible outside! We CAN'T wait in line!		
You're just realizing this now?		
......		
Ugh, and the line isn't getting any shorter. The signal's definitely		
...We've been tracking down ramen?		
Wouldn't that be a hoot?		
...... Look, just tell me. What are we after?		
......		
...... !? Wait! Do you feel that!?		
I don't get why that place is so popular. The taste is nothing to write		
Negativity. And it's coming from him.		
He's staring at the line.		
You think something's up with this shop?		
That might explain the signal I picked up.		
Let's start with the Noise on that guy.		
What's that guy's beef with the new place?		
Who can say?		
Hmm... Let's try getting rid of the Noise around him.		
One taste! That's all it would take. If people just gave my		
Hey, c'mon! No buttin' in line, kid!		
We're not getting in any time soon. Let's try again later.		
Buh! What am I doing out here? I can't afford to sit around complaining!		
He went inside.		
Let's drop by and talk to him. It's not like this line's going		
Yeah... (No mission yet, either... Weird.)		
He went back into his shop.		
Perfect. We can talk to him there.		
Irasshai!		
!? (Ugh, what's that smell?)		
I don't see anybody else, but... sounds like he's open.		
What'll you boys have today? We've got a new limited-time-only seasonal		
(What the heck kinda name is that? I'm afraid to ask what's in it. I'll		
Exciting! Make mine the Big Catch!		
(No way! He's either brave or stupid. )		
Him, too.		
(WHAT!?)		
You got it! Here ya go!		
(What, it's already done!? Is this... food?)		
Mmm! ? Fantastic.		
(Ugh, he's EATING it!)		
Mister, this is excellent!		
Like it? Gah ha ha! Ya got good taste, son!		
What's wrong? Eat up while it's hot, Acro.		
...Right. ...... ...... Huh? It's... not terrible... It's actually		
Using cheese as a hidden flavor really gives the soup body. The bold

We're OPEN. Can't you see these customers? I can't work with you around.		
Ahh, my mistake. The place was so empty, I just assumed. So... Give

Come on, champ. I need an answer soon. Do yourself a favor and join

What do the people of Shibuya want from a bowl of ramen? It's not

Anyway, give it some thought. The offer's only open for a month.		
Ha ha.... Sorry you boys had to see that...		
Are you in some kind of trouble?		
Heh... Must be, if I got kids asking about it. So, what, you wanna hear		
(Hear it and do what? We can't help him...) ......		
Shh! What're you--		
Let's hear him out. Sometimes all people need is a good listener. We		
......		
...... We can listen. But don't expect any miracles.		
Ha ha, hey, that's more than enough!		
Then, uh... go for it.		
As you can see, business is hardly booming. If I don't turn out some		
But that ramen was so good! You're closing?		
Well, if I let those guys buy me out, I can keep going...		
But you don't want to?		
The noodles they serve aren't bad, but... there's no love. They treat		
Eeeeeek!		
What the...		
Ugh, the show begins... Go on out and see for yourselves.		
Eeeeeek!		
It's the Prince! He's sooo dreamy!		
Wait, that's... (The guy I met at 104. Mr. Spicy Tuna Roll or 		
He went into that other ramen place. Let's go see.		
They're doing something at that ramen shop. Let's go take a

Exquisite! I can die in bliss. F this ramen! F...for FABULOUS!		
Omigosh, you hear that!? He F'd it!		
He only F's the stuff he really likes!		
I want to try what he got!		
That's--

I'll say. They didn't cut any corners with the presentation.		
Whoa, what? The staff dance as they cook!?		
I guess it's half food, half show.

I see what he meant by "adventure."		
The savory ramen, the eclectic venue-- I know my readers will love it		
Always a pleasure, sir! This month's our grand opening special! Every		
Whoa! That's like, super-rare!		
We seriously all get one!?		
That pin... Yeah. It's the one we promoted for a mission.		
You don't say...		
Me and Shiki, we had to make that pin catch on. ! Wait a minute... 		
Another friend of yours, Acro?		
He looks totally different. I hardly recognize him!		
That's people for you: always quick to do a 180.		
(Uh, 180? Try a 1260.)		
Still... Interesting. OK, Acro. Let's go.		
Huh?		
Stick around, and we'll get yelled at again for cutting.		
...AHEM.		
Right... Out we go.		
My, my, Acro... I believe we have an incident on our hands.		
Huh?		
A new ramen shop explodes onto the scene-- its owner, an overnight		
You think the pins are the source of the energy spike?		
Oh! And don't forget the ramen that's not selling. Odd, don't you		
(Hellooo? You listening? )		
That settles it. We'll spend today getting to the bottom of this		
"We"? I'm not about to ignore the mission when--		
What mission, Acro?		
......		
Now, let's start sniffing out the reason this place is such a big 		
The Dogenzaka Ramen Wars... Hee hee. This is quite a

Let's investigate!		
Prince, baby. You're killing me.		
Mick...		
Gotta obey that contract, hmm?		
But--		
! Hey, it's those two.		
Sounds like trouble in paradise. Let's check it out.		
Sounds like a fight... That promoter's chewing out Spicy Tuna		
...Spicy what?		
Oh, uh... never mind. Let's go see what's up.		
Why'd you change your blog entry?		
I told you. It's my blog. I write it.		
I feel you, Prince. I really do. But this is business. Your 		
But, Mick... Then it's not my blog anymore. Plus the ramen you serve		
Eiji, Eiji, Eiji... Babe. Prince. It's fine! None of those people 		
Mick...		
I'll send you next text and some pics by tonight. You'll have them up		
......		
Aha.		
Exactly. Although it looks like the Prince is tired of playing		
! Hey! The Noise have got him!		
Hmm... So they do.		
It was all staged? Ugh!		
Easy, tiger. The Prince seems ready to turn over a new 		
Ugh, that beefy ramen makes me broil! All I want is 		
This isn't right. I can't lie to my public. I'll try talking to Mick		
Even the Prince of Ennui has his woes. I guess we all do.		
Dunno why he's so hung up on ramen.		
Hee hee. We all have our hang-ups.		
Ugh, I don't get it.		
Of course you don't.		
What?		
Everyone has their own little internal world-- a secret garden only		
Yeah. (Even if I could, I wouldn't want to see inside other people. 		
Thank you all for coming out today. We appreciate your patience. As		
! Hmm? My phone's responding.		
To those pins!? Is that what you're hunting? Rare pins?		
Not quite. What I'm looking for isn't a thing.		
...... So... CAT designed these pins?		
CAT's the big graphic designer, right?		
Yes and no. They do artwork, clothes, even furniture. And that's just 		
Like the one at Towa Records?		
Yup. CAT doesn't just make art. CAT IS art.		
You're awfully knowledgeable. Are you a fan?		
Hell, yes! CAT's all about enjoying every moment, with all you've got. 		
Wow, you sound so devoted.		
That's why this pisses me off. He's using CAT's work to trick people.		
I need to outsell that sorry excuse for a ramen shop... I need...		
(Hmm, what would the kids like?)		
! Yes! That's it!		
Whoa! Dude ran back into his shop in a hurry.		
Inspiration must have struck.		
Let's see what he cooks up.		
Irasshai! Hey! I've been waiting for you two. Take a taste! See what you		
This is...		
Regular old ramen?		
Interesting... Well, here goes.		
Hold it!		
!		
Please... Let me try that.		
...... Fine...		
Thank you. Now, to dig in... ...... ...... Amazing! Is it OK for 		
Uhh... Is that a compliment?		
Of course! F for FABULOUS! ...Still. This ramen is exceptional. Let		
a whole chicken in the soup? That, and a hint of pork bone,		
It's the same ramen I've always made. Haven't changed a thing. I just		
Among the flavors, I... I can taste the love you've put in this. Your		
Everybody hits rough patches in life. So next time you're down, drop on 		
The future's a clean slate...		
Ha ha! Try a blank slate pops.		
!?		
Considering this place is gone in a month.		
What!?		
And you... Prince, baby. You're my walking billboard. Can't have you		
...... I've come to a decision, Mick. I won't work with you on this 		
Babe, babe... Calm down. You're talking crazy, Prince.		
I knew after tasting Sebastian's ramen again. I refuse to be a part

Heh... Right. I can cook a lotta ramen in one month! I'm stickin' to my		
Hopefully the guy's place will take off.		
I was thinking. "Something different"... Maybe everyone in Shibuya is		
Right. You don't want to change, but you don't want to be left behind		
Of course not. We can't go through life alone. We're part of a		
Yeah, and the more people hold you back. Screw living in a world choked		
My thoughts exactly. I'd rather just get rid of them.		
What?		
Same as you, Acro. Those headphones you wear say it all.		
(Yeah, so what? I don't like other people. I've got no use for the next		
Will you look at the time!		
And still no mission...		
It's probably too late now. Our little hunt will have to continue		
Huh?		
The signal's disappearing.		
But before it was reacting to these pins, right? It's still picking 		
There was a whole bunch of them before. Maybe they added up to a		
So why CAT's pin, anyway?		
It's not what I'm looking for. I know that...		
OK... Then what ARE you looking for?		
Well, put simply...		
......		
I'm looking for what this tracker is tracking.		
(What the... Oh, that's real helpful! What the hell is this kid after?)		
Roamin' the Streeeeets. Chapter Closed]		
......		
......		
Yesss! I win!		
This isn't fair, Acro. When did you suddenly become a Tin Pin expert?		
And why should I answer that?		
How about because I'm asking you!? Have you been secretly training?		
Maybe. Look, a win's a win. That means we wait another hour for the		
Ugh, Acro... Cut me a little slack.		
Not happening. I won. Therefore, we wait.		
Ugh, fine... But this is a huge waste of time. ...... Hello?		
(This is getting to him. Keep it up, and he's bound to crack.)		
Today fourteen Players were erased, sir.		
Leave it to a genius. At this rate, the Game won't last the week.		
About that, sir... No missions have been issued in the last two 		
None?		
None, sir. Nevertheless, Players have been disappearing at a 		
And Minamimoto?		
AWOL. He broke off contact yesterday.		
Our Game Master's gone missing?		
His so-called "works of art" have been sighted around the UG-- thus, 		
...Then let's leave him be for now.		
Meaning you won't require an inquiry into Minamimoto's activities?		
Correct. He's not a social animal. Give the man some space.		
...Understood. As you wish, Mr. Kitaniji.		
Any other problems?		
Several Reapers were attacked on Route 5, sir. We suspect Taboo 		
Taboo Noise... How does this affect our manpower?		
The losses are within tolerances. I've already set about identifying		
Very good. So the Noise explain the dwindling Player count...		
Yes, sir. I'm looking into any correlation between the two incidents		
Perfect. I'd expect no less. I leave it to you, Konishi.		
Understood, sir.		
(Sho Minamimoto... A true genius. Youngest Reaper officer in		
How can you be busy, Mr. H? Your caf       is always empty		
(Fifteen minutes and counting... Any minute now, he'll--)		
Say, Acro. Could you do me one teensy favor?		
(Bingo. Now, to beat him to the punch.) If this is about the wait, I'm		
Fine. How about a trade?		
(Right on cue!) OK... Answer my question, and I'll go with you.		
You've twisted my arm. Go on, shoot.		
...What are you after?		
You're curious?		
If you don't feel like talking, we can wait.		
Hee hee... It's nothing major. I'm going to jack Shibuya.		
...Right. How 'bout a real answer?		
That was a real answer.		
...... What? How do you jack a town?		
That's why I'm looking for the Shibuya River.		
What Shibuya River?		
My turn to ask a question. Do you really want a second chance?		
Huh?		
What's waiting for you in the RG? You're as alone there as here.		
......		
Hee hee. You don't have to answer. I don't really care. Now let's get		
Udagawa!?		
Oh, right! You know the city well, Acro.		
Shibuya born and raised.		
My, my!		
It's coming from Udagawa, right? Let's go.		
? Well, this is new... Someone's an eager beaver today.		
(The Udagawa district... Same place I saw in your head. Along with me,		
Signal's coming from Udagawa?		
Yup. Right up Center Street and past Tipsy Tose Hall.		
(Udagawa... What happened to me there?)		
...... Want past this wall? Then bring me one Sexy +. It's a pin.		
Another facile task.		
I wonder how they come up with them.		
The conditions? Probably just on a whim. Anyway, let's find		
We've got our pin. Let's get the wall cleared.		
Objective met. Wall clear!		
...... Want past this wall? Then fight through a four-reduction chain		
A four-round chain battle...		
Nervous, Acro? You can always tone the difficulty down if		
...Did I ask for advice?		
Aww... see, Acro? That wasn't so hard. All you had to do is		
......		
Hee hee. What, would you like a pat on the head?		
(Rrgh...) How 'bout we just get the wall cleared?		
...... Objective met. Wall clear!		
? Hmm? Reaper alert.		
Let's just report it to the police.		
Um, hello? We're metal. And Reapers! No way. We'd lose all our cred!		
Like you have any after boning this up.		
Sounds like an argument.		
Sounds like trouble we don't need. Let's ignore them.		
What could've happened to them?		
I don't even want to know. Let's slip on by.		
Are you lost, Acro? Udagawa is up past Tipsy Tose Hall.		
I know where it is.		
Hey! Hold up, you two.		
(Ugh... Busted.) ! Wait! You're that--		
Hey, my man! I remember you. Perfect timing. You're not busy, right? 		
Hey, my man! I remember you!		
! Wait! You're that--		
Perfect timing! You're not busy, right? Help a brother out?		
You'll hear me out? Rock!		
Ahem. We're booked. Right, Acro? Sorry, but we have somewhere to be.		
Right... Udagawa.		
What? Yo, Tenho!		
Look, we just need to get through here, and we're kind of in 		
Oh yeah? Yo, Tenho!		
On it.		
!? What? A wall!? Hey!		
You wanna get through here? Help us out.		
......		
Thrusting your person problems on Players? How very professional.		
Crap, they closed off the road to Udagawa.		
Then I suppose we're stuck. May as well hear them out.		
Ugh, this is so not our problem...		
So what's the deal?		
Long story short? Our band's microphone has gone missing!		
......		
Happened around 2:00 yesterday. We had a little gig at Molco, right? 		
Yeah, says you. You prob'ly just left it someplace.		
I'm tellin' you, BJ, it was stolen! That thing is Def March's heart 'n'		
Who the hell would want a mic with wings?		
......		
Wh-what?! Hey, YOU lost it!		
Ugh... Fine. Let's just split up and look for it, OK?		
(Why are WE looking for YOUR junk!?)		
Screw that, man. You lost it. You find it. I'm outta here. ! Oh, Tenho...		
Oh, snap...		
I found it lyin' around.		
Thanks, man. I was wigging out trying to find it. Where was it?		
!? In the... uhh, I mean... S-Spain Hill!		
......		
I'm headin' back to A-East. Later.		
I'll go look around Molco again...		
Thanks!		
I still don't see how this is our problem...		
Aww, c'mon. Look, I'll pay ya. Help us out.		
No way! We're--		
Here, lemme pay you before I forget!		
(Ugh! Punk beat me to the draw...)		
Well then! Let's begin, hmm? We'll start by gathering		
(He's enjoying this. The little weirdo is enjoying this.		
Step one is gathering info, starting with the client.		
(Yoshiya Kiryu, private dick extraordinaire.)		
Hey, boys! Get crackin'.		
Can you give us a little more to go on?		
Sure! Whaddaya need to know?		
Describe the stolen microphone.		
It's a stand mic with black wings.		
Black wings?		
Yeah, it's the band's symbol.		
Who'd want a bat-mic?		
I can think of one guy...		
Really!? Who?		
Freakin' BJ.		
BJ?		
Guy in the black hoodie? He was just here. He's been whining about		
Wait, he stole it because... he wanted to be a vocalist? That makes no		
What happened when the mic was taken?		
I actually didn't tell the other guys, but... just before it 		
A phone call?		
Yeah. Thinking back now, it was pretty shady.		
Why was the call shady?		
They didn't give me their name... Just, "Meet me by Cadoi City." "We 		
Any guesses?		
Not really. Called ID said it was a public phone. Sounded like an		
So... did you go?		
Yeah, but nobody was there. When I got back to Molco, the mic was gone.		
That IS shady.		
So someone called to lure you away. And you think the Reaper in black		
As much as I hate to consider it...		
Well, good luck, guys. I'll be right here.		
(Ugh... What a pain.) So? What now?		
Well, it's obvious, isn't it? We investigate the crime scene and		
What, have you done this before?		
So we've got Molco and the two bandmates. Let's get started.		
Next up, the bandmates. The one in black, BJ, went to A-		
Fine. Let's go talk to them.		
! Hmm? Isn't that...		
......		
Let's see what he has to say.		
We still have questioning to do. The one in black, BJ, is 		
Any luck finding the mic?		
......		
I'd like to ask you a few questions.		
...Sure, whatever.		
777 said the mic was the band's soul. What makes it so special?		
It just is. Back when we were still busking on the streets, we all		
I see...		
But lately 777 and BJ have been fighting over who gets to sing-- over		
You must be happy, then-- the object dividing them is out of the		
Yeah... ...B-but not that happy! I just... Hmph. Never mind.		
Where were you yesterday at 2: 00?		
! ...R-right here?		
(Are you asking us or telling us?)		
Ah, yes. BJ said he found your phone on Spain Hill.		
Yeah... Must've dropped it here. Well, I don't see our mic here. I'm		
You've been very helpful.		
That takes care of Tenho's testimony. Let's see what BJ has		
......		
He should be back at A-East. Let's mosey on that way.		
He said the mic went missing at Molco, right?		
Look. A phone booth.		
Oh, right. 777 said the call came from a pay phone. Then let's--		
Hey there! Aren't you, like, Players?		
And you two are... Ahh, yes! The winners of the slam-off.		
You, like, remember us? Super yay!		
You need something?		
So, like, I'm always with the same guy, and I wanted to talk to somebody		
What're your names?		
I'm Souvik. This is Acro.		
Nice meetin' ya, Acro, J-dawg. I'm Sota. The cute one's Nao.		
Call me Nao-Nao for short, 'K?		
Uhh... sure.		
Hey, did you guys know? No missions yesterday or today, but Players are		
Wiped out?		
You should be careful, Nekky!		
N-Nekky?		
We saw some real scary Noise before? We ran like bunnies! You should,		
Let's just all stay sharp and get through this together, huh?		
Uh, yeah.		
Hmm? Didn't you know?		
Hey, man, don't--		
Even if multiple Players survive... only so many get to come back to		
What? Um, like, uncool?		
The other Players aren't your friends. They're your competition. That		
No way... If, like, two people survive? And only one gets to go back? 		
They play again, same as Nekky here.		
......		
Whoa, like, this is your second time?		
...Yeah.		
Then your partner made it back!		
No... she didn't.		
Huh? I don't get it.		
She was taken as my entry fee.		
No way! That's, like, super cruel!		
I chose to play again, and she... It's my fault she didn't make it ba--		
No worries, man.		
Huh?		
She was your entry fee, yeah? That means you really care about her. No		
Yeah! It's, like, totally not your fault! I'd gladly be Sota's entry fee		
And I'd play the Game a million times for Nao. Whatever it takes to get		
...... You don't think I'm to blame?		
Forget blame, man! Plus, I don't care if only one of us gets a second		
Yeah! Like, fighting so isn't the answer? We all want to be alive again.		
A pin?		
Yeah! We, like, won it at the slam-off? And now it's yours. Yay!		
You sure?		
We couldn't use it. Not that we're dumping our trash on you, but...		
Thanks.		
We should probably move on, yeah?		
Be safe, Nekky! Bye, Josh-Josh! Like, see you later?		
They were charming.		
Nobody deserves it most...		
Hmm?		
(It's true... Everybody's got their own deal. Their own dreams. None of		
Hee hee... Talk about your non sequiturs.		
Sorry... ...So how 'bout we check out that phone?		
Something went down in that phone booth.		
Right. Let's have a look.		
Hmm, no microphones here...		
Thank you, Captain Obvious. 777 said the call came from a pay phone. Is		
This looks like a job for my phone!		
...Huh? What, the tracker?		
No, the other new feature.		
What other new feature?		
The camera.		
Don't most phones already have a camera?		
Hee hee... Watch and learn. I simply set the time to yesterday, 		
What and learn what? It's a photo.		
Hmm... Let's try a different time.		
! Ahh! The mic!		
So it was right here at this time yesterday.		
What the heck? How did your phone--		
Weren't you listening to Mr. H? He added a couple of new features.		
Holy... (That's Mr. H's work? Who the hell IS he?) So, could you shift		
Let's try.		
That's... BJ, right? ! And the mic's gone!		
Hmm, very suspicious.		
Let's take one more, just to be--		
Can't.		
Huh?		
There's a three-shot-per-day limit.		
What? Why!?		
How should I know!? Ask Mr. H!		
(Suddenly, it's a lot less impressive...) Then we'll use mine. ? 		
Something wrong?		
My phone has no camera.		
Hmm... He must have forgotten to do yours.		
......		
!		
Hmm?		
Isn't that...		
Sigh... I thought for sure it'd work.		
Let's see what he has to say.		
We still have questioning to do. We've already talked to		
Sigh...		
AHEM.		
!! Gah! Wh-what!?		
Weren't you headed back to A-East?		
...... ...I wanted to lose myself in the crowd for a bit. Y'know?		
(Can't say that I do, actually.)		
We just had a few questions for you.		
Look, what do you want?		
About the stolen mic--		
Stolen? Please. 777's full of it. I'm sure he just left it someplace.		
I hear that you wanted that mic for yourself.		
So what if I did? Doesn't matter now. I don't need it anyway.		
Where were you yesterday at 2:00?		
! Oh, uh... I was... You know, uhh ...Dogenzaka! Yeah! In line for the 		
Mm-hmm...		
Wh-what? Just gimme some space, would ya? I want to spend some time 		
Of course. But first... take a look at this photo.		
Wha-- How did--		
That's the phone booth near Molco. Aka the phone booth of love.		
Gah!		
Isn't there some kind of urban legend? They say if you use this phone		
Oh, um... really!?		
I don't know who you called. But you were there yesterday. That much		
But I--		
You weren't in Dogenzaka. You were chatting up some tramp near Molco.		
She's NOT a tramp!		
(Damn, Josh.... Remind me not to tick you off.)		
You can't tell ANYONE about this! OK, so I was there yesterday! I made a		
Quite. You've been very helpful, thanks.		
Ugh... I'm headin' back to see 777. Hopefully he's found the stupid mic		
I don't think we're getting anything else out of him. Let's move on.		
Well, we've heard from everybody.		
Yes, it would seem our profile is complete.		
Uhh...what?		
Hee hee. You'll see. Let's head back to Tipsy Tose Hall.		
Well, if we haven't found it by now... it's probably not turning up. 		
Not so fast...		
Huh?		
I think I've identified your thief.		
You serious!?		
Wait, what?		
Hee hee. Let's recap, hmm? The theft occurred yesterday at 2:00. 777		
What phone call?		
"Meet me by Cadoi City. We need to talk." The microphone was stolen		
......		
According to 777's caller ID, the call originated at a public phone.		
! What!? Y-you guys aren't gonna--		
This photo shows... Acro?		
What, I'M telling them!? Uhh, this photo tells it all...		
Wait... BJ!?		
I told you not to say anything!		
So it WAS you who called me!		
Whoa there. When did you get that call? Precisely, that is.		
Uhh, lemme check... 1:40.		
Take a closer look at the photo. See? It was taken at 2:02. BJ used		
......		
No, he was calling a lady friend, hmm? To whisper sweet nothings in		
AHHHHH! ...... OK! OK! I admit-- I told a chick I like her! And she		
...... Deep breath, Beej. That isn't the point of the photo. Look		
Hmm? Is that a cell phone?		
Certainly looks like it. But not BJ's.		
I don't get it...		
Look at this photo. Would you do the honors, Acro?		
......		
Acro, Acro, Acro... The OTHER photo.		
......		
The one of the mic? What about it?		
Ignore the microphone. Look on top of the telephone.		
It's that cell phone!		
Correct. It was there when BJ arrived. He saw it, and took it. Now, 		
Cause it belonged to... ! Waaait a minute!		
You knew the owner. So you picked it up and returned it.		
Oh, Tenho... This your phone, bro?		
Oh, snap...		
I found it lyin' around.		
Thanks, man. I was wigging out trying to find it. Where was it?		
!? In the... uhh, I mean... S-Spain Hill!		
Tenho!? But...but... BJ said he found the cell on Spain... ! Ohhhhhh.		
BJ didn't want anyone finding out he got blown off. So he lied about		
...... I'm sorry, guys. It was all me.		
What? Why, man!?		
I thought it'd stop you two fighting. I don't want us to break up...		
...... Sorry, bro. We put you through a lot, huh?		
Yeah, my bad, Tenho. I was outta line about wantin' to do vocals...		
...... But that's all over now, right!? We good again?		
Heh, I'm cool.		
Good. Now let's have that mic, Tenho...		
It, uhh... It kinda got stolen.		
WHAT!?		
I called 777 from that phone booth. Once he left, I grabbed the mic. I		
Gone?		
Yeah. This was in there in its place...		
A megaphone?		
With some freaky stuff recorded in it...		
......		
......		
......		
I'm sorry, guys! I just wanted us to stay together! Now, because of		
(That megaphone could only belong to one person.)		
Hee hee... Fascinating. It seems this mystery runs deeper! Care to		
No brainer. The guy who took the mic is...		
Hee hee. You can tell them the truth, Acro. Now let's have		
None of these guys.		
Meet me by Cadoi City. We need to talk.		
...... Now's my chance!		
Oh, crap! 777! Gah! Gotta hide! ...... Whew...		
Hmm? My phone?		
Ugh... Be right back, mic. Stay put.		
! Hmm? Why, hello! This mic is zetta sexy! Perfect for my opus!		
OK. OK. Let's do this. I'm gonna tell her. I'm gonna... ! Huh? That's		
...Sniff. Phone booth of love my ass!		
! Now, to pick up the-- Gah! It's gone!? ...The hell is this 		
Great story. Now where's our mic?		
Hmm... Knowing him? In that junk heap over there.		
What!?		
Our baby is in that pile of trash!?		
Start digging, boys!		
...... Sorry to drag you guys into this. I cleared the wall. Go on.		
Best of luck.		
Now then! Shall we head to Udagawa, Acro?		
That was the detour from hell...		
Well, the road is open. Let's leave them to their fishing		
...Right.		
Gotchu punks.		
!		
Hope you brought your A-game today, yo.		
Beat... Don't do this. I don't want to fight you.		
Beggin' won't work, yo!		
Look, I have to win! For Shiki, too! So would you please go away!?		
Shut it! Le's jus' do this!		
(Nngh... That's about all I've got...)		
Yo yo yo, you even tryin'? Hit harder! I barely felt that! Man, y'all 		
Whew... That was pretty close.		
......		
He's serious. He must really not like you.		
...... (I could see him hating me. ...But why erase Shiki, too? Is he		
Hmm? What's this, Acro?		
A pendant? ! (This was Rhyme's.) Beat must've dropped it.		
I guess so.		
(He's no genius, but he must've had a reason to join them. This meant a		
We can get through to Udagawa now. ...About time.		
(About time is right. Now I can find out what that memory's		
Know Udagawa well, Acro?		
Yeah. I used to come here after school.		
With your friends?		
Please. I don't do groups. I never met anyone fun to be around.		
Hee hee. Me neither. We seem to have a lot in common. You know, 		
Where did that come from!?		
The UG is split into different areas. Shibuya's just one of them, 		
Mr. H told you all that?		
...Oh, so you know about our conversations.		
......		
As I was saying, every area has its own rules. They never meddle with		
That could apply to anyone.		
Hee hee... Maybe so. As long as we all have our own worlds, people 		
Right? They're them, and I'm me. Talking to them gets me nothing. I		
"Do what you want, how you want, when you want it," was it?		
Yeah. It blew me away. CAT was living the life I always wanted to, but		
Absolutely. Who needs other people's values? It's easier to just live		
Yeah... (But... I don't feel that way anymore. Since coming to the UG,		
Yoo-hoo? Acro?		
......		
Well, we may be stuck in Shibuya. But you can still see a fair ways.		
......		
Hee hee. That mural you mentioned is up ahead, right? The signal's		
The signal's coming from further back. Shall we?		
......		
3 is the point of the 1.		
!		
4 the 1-5-9 are 2.		
! Hey, it's...		
Shh! Let's see what he's up to.		
6-5, 3-5! 8-9, 7-9! 32384 62643 38327! And... perfect. Soon... 		
What was all that about?		
This is...		
Vandalism? He drew it just now, right? More of his loony art?		
I wonder... My phone's responding to it.		
To these scribbles? I thought you were looking for the Shibuya River.		
I am.		
Uhh... I don't see any rivers.		
Thank you, Acro. ...What IS this? Considering the artist, it can't be		
Well? Should we erase it?		
He'll know. Besides, it could be a trap. Let's leave it for now. 		
(Now's the best time. If I take him to where I was lying on the		
Say, Acro?		
Wh-what?		
I'd like to check over by that mural. Do you mind?		
Uh...sure. (The weasel beat me to it... What's he need over there?)		
Ugh, finally!		
Deep breath, girl.		
Don't give me that! Why'd those two brats have to show up? They're so		
Uzuki... Get on the horn with HQ. Now.		
What? Why?		
That's a Taboo Noise refinery sigil.		
That!? I never knew what they looked like... So the GM's gone		
Not quite. This sigil still hasn't been used. There must be another		
...Do you smell that, Kariya? Promotions! Glory!		
I'll pass. Instead of buyin' me that bowl of ramen, you can just take		
What, you're too lazy to even claim credit?		
Something like that. 'Sides... I may have another mystery to unravel.		
(What is he thinking? ......)		
Impressive graffiti.		
It's CAT's. This is my favorite spot. (And the spot where I died in		
Still with me, Acro?		
Huh?		
You spaced out.		
Oh... Sorry.		
You've giving me d   		
What!? (D      j       vu? From when? Did... d		
(...... I need to know. Gotta scan him...)		
(I... It was here.)		
Something wrong, Acro?		
(He... He killed me!)		
Hello?		
...I'm here. Just a little dizzy. I'm fine.		
Good. Let's move on. Nothing else to see here. Ugh, this tracker's		
(How can he act so normal around a guy he killed? He sought me out as a		
Pinned. Chapter Closed]		
Hello? Yeah, Mr. H? It's me. You gave me a bum tracker!		
(He killed me... Why? What would he stand to gain? Fastest way is just		
There's no mission today either. Yeah, we can get there. Something 		
(Three more days with him. He's a loose cannon. I need to watch my		
You better! OK, thanks. Later.		
(This is for Shiki. I can last a few more days.)		
All set?		
First, I have a question.		
Oh? What is it today, Acro?		
What are you after?		
This again? I told you. I'm jacking Shibuya.		
But what does that mean? You're looking for some river. Then what? Tell		
...... Sigh... Fine. I'll keep this simple. Remember who's in charge		
The Composer.		
Very good. Right now HE'S got Shibuya jacked. Under his control. I		
Change it? ...Wait. You want to bust in on the Composer with guns		
Eventually. I have to find him first. He should be at the Shibuya		
So it's the Composer... We've been running around Shibuya looking for		
With a busted tracker, yes.		
...... ! Wait, so the Grim Heaper's been after...		
Me, most likely. I guess he's onto me.		
Ugh, just what I need. I'm in this to win! I can't afford any 		
Neither can I.		
(Then why are you... Ugh, this kid is the devil!)		
Ready to go to Mr. H's?		
What for?		
To get him to fix this glitchy tracker.		
You're still going after the Composer?		
Of course. Now come on. You've asked your question.		
......		
So, Kariya. What's this big mystery you mentioned yesterday?		
Oh, just Phones and the petit prince.		
Those two? What about 'em?		
We're about to go find out.		
Wait, find out how? It's hands off the Players. GM's orders, remember?		
So I'll use my head. Besides, we're just going to play a little game.		
...... And that's different how?		
Details.		
Well, I'm stinkin' bored. Count me in!		
......		
Well, Acro? Let's go see Mr. H. I hope you haven't 		
Past Cadoi City and Towa Records.		
Very good, Acro! Oh, I'm so proud.		
......		
So get moving.		
There's the Moyai Statue again.		
Say, Acro... Do you know how the statue got here?		
No clue.		
Well... It was a gift. The island of Niijima		
No kidding.		
Just like you and me, Acro. The very picture of "moyai."		
......		
Whoa there.		
! Huh?		
Hey, kids. How goes?		
You're... What do you want?		
You up for a little game?		
Excuse me?		
Look, we're busy here.		
Zing! Where's the love? Yo, Uzuki.		
On it!		
Huh?		
Wall's up! Sowwy.		
Hey!		
Now then... Game on? I think so!		
Rrgh... Great.		
Dammit, what did they want?		
My guess is they've set up walls along Route 2... all the		
(There's no mission! Why screw us over?)		
Oh, well. We'll just have to play along.		
...... Passage denied. Pick another route.		
...... Want past this wall? Then turn D+B into the hottest thing		
Make it number one?		
You seem a little lost.		
We just gotta wear D+B pins and items into combat.		
Wow, I'm... I'm a little surprised. I didn't think fashion		
(Shiki taught me.)		
I see... Well, let's take care of this.		
OK. D+B's on top of the charts. ...... Uhh... What's with all		
Hee hee. Behold, the power of trends. Now, let's get that		
Objective met. Wall clear!		
YAAAWN. ...I'm so over this whole wall thing. Today was supposed to		
He wants ramen? Hmm... There was the guy's shop on Dogenzaka.		
Hee hee. Have you ever been to the beach, Acro?		
...Yes.		
If you got a mouthful of ocean, it would taste...		
Uhh... salty? !		
Very good! So, which flavor of ramen is salty?		
Ahh... Got it.		
Dogenzaka... That guy's ramen shop was around here.		
Say, Acro... Do you know where Dogenzaka got its name?		
Nope.		
And you call yourself a local.		
......		
There are two stories. One attributes the name to Owada Dogen, a		
You don't say.		
The other story claims the name comes from a temple. Dogenzaka also		
Can't say that I have.		
You should. I mean, just think! You're walking through the pages of		
I feel so epic.		
...... Sigh... Acro, is any of this sinking in?		
Oh, yeah.		
You sure? ...... All right. Pop quiz. Name the bandit who gave		
No, Acro. Wrong. Someone forgot to put on his good listener		
......		
Very good! What an excellent listener.		
Yup. That's me...		
! Ooh, you brought it! ...Ugh. Where'd you get it? It looks foul. 		
...... Passage denied. Pick another route.		
...... Miss me? Like a bolt from the blue, it's time for the Reaper		
If you say so... Question 2! What's the secret menu item he only		
I know, right? Question 3! How much will a bowl of shio ramen run you		
Aha! I see what you did there. OK... The results are in! Reaper		
Bzzzt! So sorry! I can't let you pass-- until you pass.		
Ugh, and we were just there! Remember... C'mon, remember!		
Hmm... Well, no sense beating your head against a wall. 		
...... Did you do your homework, kids? Then away we go! 		
You pass! So pass on through. But! Though you may forget the Review--		
Ugh... And here I got my hopes up! THIS was your game? Booo-ring! So,		
Wrong kid.		
What, you're eyeing the snobby one? What about him?		
Oh, you'll see...		
...... Want past this wall? Heh heh heh. ...You. Orangeylocks.		
Me?		
Yeah, you! Come back wearing all Mus Rattus threads. Do that, and 		
Mus Rattus, huh?		
That's the bargain brand that's branched out all over		
Me? Wear that? Ugh, I hate these walls...		
All right, I'm a walking ball of Rat. Can we get that wall		
Pfft... Snrrk!		
Can I help you?		
Oh, no. I'm just fine. Ready to go... Ratty McRatterson?		
Happy now?		
Pfft! Aha ha... What a chintzy outfit, man! It suits you.		
...Excuse me!?		
Objective met. Wall clear!		
Hee hee... He said it suits you, Acro.		
I heard him!		
...... Want past this wall? Play me at Tin Pin! You ready? Here we go!		
C'mon, hurry up!		
He wants to play Tin Pin? That's his big demand?		
Aww, indulge the poor man. Let's see those moves from the		
......		
Here we go!		
...Crap. Is there NOBODY in this world I can actually beat!? Sigh...		
Woo hoo! My first victory! Thanks for sucking so bad. Wall		
...... Want past this wall? Then here. Defeat these Noise! ...BUT. I		
What's the holdup?		
Take a deep breath? What's THAT supposed to mean?		
Hee hee... It means some pins react to curious things.		
Then here we go!		
Objective met. Wall clear!		
And you're done. Thanks for playin'.		
......		
Later!		
...... What was that about?		
Who knows. What a waste of time.		
What the hell was all that about?		
Who knows. Anyway, the road's open. Let's go see Mr. H.		
...Well? Figure anything out?		
Maybe.		
Can you be a little more specific?		
Ugh, sorry... Yashiro here. ...... Taboo Noise? ...All right.		
Hmm?		
Another Taboo Noise sighting.		
Lovely. Where at?		
HQ lost sight of 'em on Dogenzaka. Well? Let's go!		
Go where?		
What do you mean, where? After them!		
You said HQ lost sight of 'em. Are we supposed to wander around all		
Got a better plan?		
Let those kids be the bait. Then we just tag along until the Taboo		
Oh, hey guys. Let's see that phone.		
Thanks. It's been responding to most of Shibuya.		
I'll have it fixed in a jiffy. Sit tight.		
Ah! Acro's phone, too. The camera.		
Right. Got it.

Hmm? What's this, now?		
When we first met, you said you'd been watching me. What does that 		
...... Ahh. So that's what this is all about.

I've always been able to see the UG.		
(This is the freaky ability Hanekoma mentioned?) Even when you were		
That's right. Lucky me, right? I saw things others couldn't. I knew		
So you were watching me from the RG.		
The Game intrigued me. I was following it on my own when I met Mr. H.		
When was that?		
Oh, years ago. So I became a regular at his shop, listening to his

So you... came here?		
Yeah. I decided I belonged in the UG.		
...... And you thought I did, too?		
...Hmm?		
You want to be here? Fine. But not me. You ki--		
All done!		
Really? Let's have a look.		
Dammit!		
That do it before I head out?		
Oh? Where are you going?		
Just a little errand. Shop's closed for today. Later, boys. 2-3, 2-		
...... Well, the tracker's fixed. Shall we? Oh, before we do... Acro?

It's them!		
Hey, no touchy, Freshmeat. Rules are rules. Reapers can't attack		
Yeah, and we're all on standby. GM's orders. Leave the Players alone.		
I'm special! I'm runnin' a special op for the Conductor, yo.		
Special op!?		
My, my! A rising star, are we?		
That's right, Lolly. Twinkle twinkle.		
Ugh! Why'd he pick you? I have seniority!		
Beats me. Now you senior citizens can hobble off, aight?		
Aaargh! Cocky little punk!		
C'mon, girl, take it with dignity. Let's leave the kids in peace. 		
Pfft, whatever. Aight, Phones, le's dance!		
Urg... Now that's more like it.		
Beat, stop! You dropped--		
I'ma drop YOU, hard!		
Will you STOP!? This pendant is yours.

You dropped it the other day, Beat.		
Yeah, sure. Now gimme it back! If you think you can use that to

...... ...Why'd you gimme it? We enemies, yo.		
It's important to you, isn't it?		
...... Hmph. Dontchu be expectin' any thanks.		
(...Bye, Beat.)		
Is the delinquent Reaper gone? Hmm... A special op...		
What about it?		
Oh, nothing. Let's go.		
(Beat...)		
Such a bother. Ah, well. Let's keep moving.		
This is CAT's latest...

Huh? CAT opened a caf      ? Wh		
You feeling alright, Acro? How many times have you been there now?

Yes, way. CAT is Mr. H.		
NO WAY! Mr. Hanekoma!? Is CAT!? Whoa...whoa! OK, calm down.		
Hee hee. I'll try.		
Mr. H? Seriously? I don't believe it!		
How did you not know this? I thought you were CAT's biggest fan.		
He never does interviews in person. He's never released any photos,		
Hee hee. I'm happy you're happy. Just don't tell him where you heard,		
I won't. (So, if Hanekoma is CAT... That means he's... CAT's NOT the

Is it? I bet you'd have little trouble.

We will.		
You don't have to worry. All we're doing is locating the		
Good, the signal is coming in stronger. We're heading in

And here we are.		
So the river is up ahead? This is where the Composer is?		
Hee hee. We shall see.		
...Here?		
Looks like the tracker's working now. Welcome to the Shibuya River.		
Since when is there a river here? That's news to me.		
The Composer's just ahead.		
......		
! ......		
...What?		
We're blocked out.		
This is the end of the line?		
Unless we get rid of that wall. Let's head back and gather more info.		
(Gather it where? Who the hell'd know about this?)		
(A way through that wall? How the heck does he plan on		
We found your river. Satisfied?		
For now.		
What the...		
Noise? The same kind as before!		
Get ready!		
Did we kill it!?		
Apparently not... Looks like we're outmatched.		
Rrgh! I can't give up now...		
...... Oh, all right... I was hoping to avoid this.		
Holy... Since when can you do THAT!?		
I told you, I hate working up a sweat.		
Braaa-vo!		
Who's there!?		
Afternoon, kids. ...Hey, pretty boy. You're ALIVE, ain't ya?		
What!?		
That was one helluva blast. No way a Player could do that. You don't		
No!		
But... I won't.		
Huh?		
Too much work. 'Sides, that Noise was givin' us hell, too. So let's		
...Whew. Lucky us, huh, Acro?		
Souvik... Was that true? You're alive?		
...... Cat's out of the bag. Yes, Acro. I'm playing the Game alive.

There's a loophole to everything. Sneaking in means I don't have a

Please, it's not a big deal. We formed a valid pact. We're just like

No, you're playing because you want to live again. You still get		
You little bastard... Only what you TOOK from me! YOU killed me!		
Aww, Acro. You said you didn't remember! You sneaky little thing. So

What if I am the one who killed you? You're going to do something

Back at the scramble again... (One more day down. Hey, where's...)		
Yeah, we found it. We just can't get in.		
(On the phone... Mr. H again? Why would he help this kid? Does he know		
All right. I'll call you. Morning, sunshine.		
Har har. You're killing me, Josh. Oh, wait...		
Again, say it was me. What are you going to do?		
That's easy! I'll--

The bosses of 0+5... Meaning two fights?		
Is 2.23 whatever code for something?		
Let's leave that for now. First let's see where we have access to.		
You're sure into this today. What do you care about missions?		
I care plenty, Acro. I am a Player.		
You're alive.		
Maybe so, but I'm still a Player. If I'm erased here in the UG, the

Either way, we were lucky. I shouldn't have been so careless. Stay		
Since when do Noise instigate fights?		
Yeah, weird.		
Looks like today may be eventful. Let's watch our backs.		
What's up with the Noise today? They're acting so strange...		
There are generally two types of Noise. Strays that emerge from		
The Grim Heaper's out for blood?		
Most likely.		
Ugh. (Well, he can bring it on.) Let's go!		
Gyaaah!		
!! Look!		
The hell is up with this Noise!?		
A Reaper. He's being attacked by Noise!		
Well, Acro?		
We've gotta help him!		
If you say so.		
More!?		
These'll have to come first. He'll have to tough it out till then.		
Rrgh! Hurry!		
That Reaper! Where'd he...		
......		
......		
Gone, I'm afraid.		
We left him to die...		
We did what we had to, Acro.		
......		
Still... Why was that Noise attacking a Reaper?		
Do Noise made by Reapers not attack them?		
That's what I'd heard, anyway... ......		
What the hell are these, then?		
Let's make a break for it.		
Wise choice.		
Yeaaaugh!		
...... That Reaper... He's...		
That's not your concern, Acro. Let's move along.		
......		
You shouldn't feel bad, Acro. You didn't know him.		
......		
Now let's get going.		
We don't have any time to waste. Let's hurry.		
A wise choice.		
Man... What ARE those things?		
It looks like the Reapers are having a time of it, too.		
(Whatever they are, they're not stopping me.)		
!! Look!		
Nngh! More of 'em?		
Sota, sorry... I can't...		
Nao! Stay with me! We're finishing this thing together!		
I'd... love to... but it... doesn't look like I can. Sorry... Sota...		
Nao!		
Nao! Dammit... DAMMIT!		
No!		
Without a partner... he won't be far behind. Well, Acro? Do we help 		
......		
You have to ask!? Let's go!		
We have to keep... Urg, no!!! I can't just leave him!		
Nngh! Nao... Looks like I won't be far behind ya. !? Huh? Aren't you--		
We'll handle this! C'mon, Souvik!		
I'm ready.		
You OK?		
Yeah... You saved my ass. Heh, for now, anyway. I lost Nao... I don't

Let's go. It's up to us to clear today's mission.		
Hee hee. Certainly looks that way.		
(For all the other Players... We have to win this!)		
Looks like Route 5's the only one open.		
Route 5?		
From the scramble crossing out to Udagawa.		
So that 2.2 number...		
2.2360679. It's the square root of 5.		
Ugh, Pi-Face and his lame jokes. So what's the 0 + 5?		
Route 5 spans a total of six areas. The scramble, Center Street, AMX,		
Udagawa would be 5.		
Precisely. Problem solved. Our targets are the bosses of the scramble		
All right. Let's get this mission done. Next stop, Udagawa!		
All that remains is the boss of Udagawa.		
Let's move. We're ending this now.		
!! Them, too!?		
Huff...huff...		
Still with me?		
Where the hell did these Taboo Noise come from?		
Game Master musta cooked 'em up.		
And sent them out after us Reapers? What is he, crazy!?		
Incoming, Uzuki!		
They're having a rough time of it.		
......		
Well, Acro? Do we send in the cavalry?		
Let's do it. They'll hate it.		
You're so vindictive.		
You guys OK?		
You two... Why'd you help us? Are you, like, stupid? We're your 		
Whew! You guys saved our butts. We were eight kinds of boned.		
What? Kariya!		
Enemy or not, if somebody helps you, you say thanks.		
Ugh, whatever. I didn't ask for your help! Just thinking about it 		
Two simple words. Is it that hard?		
She'd rather have been Noise food?		
Maybe "barf" is her version of "thank you." Let's get moving.		
We can't risk it. Let's run		
Wise choice.		
This is getting ugly... Kariya, we're pulling out!		
Yes, ma'am!		
We're here. What's the time?		
Thirty minutes left.		
Piece of cake. Let's wreck this thing!		
Mission cleared. (Hang in there, Shiki. One more day...)		
Heh heh heh... Zetta fun times.		
!? Zetta...		
(Nrrgh! My head... again...)		
Hee hee. Why, hello there. Bored again? Or maybe just lonely.		
Can't have you 2 dying on me. My calculations'd go haywire. I'd

Ahh! So you were the mystery helper in the first fight. Thanks for		
Anyone too weak to beat a 000 like that is garbage. CRUNCH!

Remember what tomorrow is? Day 7! That magical day when I get to		
Not too fast, I hope.		
299, 792, 458 m/s!		
What?		
The speed of light?		
I'll correct the deviation that saved you last time we met here.		
(The pain's fading... Are he and I connected or something?)		
Tomorrow won't be fun. I can only imagine what he'll try.		
("Last time"? What did he mean by that? Was he talking to Souvik? He 		
That concludes Yashiro's report.		
So the Taboo Noise were Minamimoto's doing.		
This is grave treason, sir. Allow me to handle Minamimoto.		
No need. I'll discuss his punishment with the Composer. Your input is		
...Understood. However, this is a matter of urgency. I hope you'll		
You may. The rules are very clear.		
Yes, sir. One closing remark-- A certain Player has exhibited great

Day 7...		
Indeed. Kind of a shame. We never found a way into the Shibuya River.		
...... Souvik... Why'd you kill me?		
I killed who, now?		
Drop it, Josh. You said it yourself.		
I just asked what you'd do if I had.		
Look, did you or--		
Rrgh... The mission. When we're through with this, you're telling me		
Hee hee. Whatever you say, Acro.		
"Game 7: Erase the Game Master at Pork City. time = 600 minutes.

What?		
This mission seems odd. Ah, well. No sense in worrying about it. 		
That's past Dogenzaka. Let's go.		
After you.		
Today we put the Grim Heaper to sleep.		
He's in Pork City, just past Dogenzaka. Hee hee... How very

Looks like it's Pork City or nowhere.

Yeah... It is a bit different. No riddles. No weird numbers.

Now this all of a sudden... Think it's a trap?		
Who can say? Though I have my guesses. Hee hee. All we can do is play		
Right.		
Hmm... Cow and mouse...		
The heck does that mean?		
Cow and mouse? What's that about?		
Hee hee. Acro, out of curiosity... do you know what D+B		
Pfft... Seriously?		
Another fun trivia tidbit-- Mus Rattus is Latin for rat.		
So, D+B and Mus Rattus...		
Hey! It's you guys! Perfect timing!

How's that?		
All the stray thoughts in Shibuya flow through here. They hit Pork		
And he's sitting on top of it all? Smug bastard.		
Attention seekers do tend to favor high places.		
That's him all right. (I just need to take him out. Sit tight, Shiki.)

That's the mission. Erase the Game Master here in Pork City.

Nope. Mr. Minamimoto told us to guard this spot. That was six

They're here on a mission, right? Why not do the usual?

Probably. But even so... Pork City is kind of an exception to begin

Not for long. Let's head upstairs and beat him down.		
Apparently, something about this building restricts the

Why are they here?

You play the Game well. Let me take a moment to congratulate you--		
Assist you? I don't think so.		
Ah, but did you not rid us of Sho Minamimoto, the rebel?		
Rebel? He wasn't on your side? Then that last mission--		
Was issued by me.		
You used us! What did you do to Souvik?		
Souvik is no more.		
No...		
He took the brunt of Minamimoto's attack. Both boy and lion vanished.		
Then he died... protecting me? Why would he do that?		
He must have had some affection for you as a partner.		
......		
He was a fool, though. No partner merits that kind of sacrifice.		
...I did this. (I blamed him. He's gone because of me. I accused him of		
I can see you're taking this hard. But you needn't blame yourself.		
That's not funny!		
And, we mustn't overlook his grave transgressions. Meddling with the 		
P-punished!?		
With erasure.		
What!?		
...At least, were I to go strictly by the book.		
Huh?		
But lucky for you, we repay our debts. The Composer has generously		
Another Game? But what about Shiki? What happens to her!?		
Nothing. The last Game is null and void. Your entry fee will be		
That's... That's the penalty?		
No. Your penalty is disqualification from all Games beyond the next.		
This is my last shot?		
Now, I must collect your entry fee.		
I... I already paid!		
For your last entry, yes. But one entry fee is required for each 		
Dammit... What else can you possibly take from me?		
It's already been taken.		
...What?		
That sucks, man. How can Shades be such a sneaky bastard? Takin' all 		
Doesn't matter. I was forced into this either way. Shiki's still		
win. Souvik bought me this chance. I'm		
Aight, then. Come on.		
What?		
You comin' with me, Phones.		
Why?		
Cause I got someplace to go.		
Um, I said I have to clear these missio--		
To the station underpass, yo! Book it!		
H-hey, wait! Listen to what I'm telling you!!!		
Le's head for the underpass, Phones! Dontchu slow me down, 		
Hey... Hold up!		
Yo yo yo! I said the station underpass!		
......		
!!		
A wall. No red Reaper in sight, either. We can't go this way today.		
Stupid @#!%(#^)^@^ WALL! I ain't got time for this! Get in my way, and		
He... he tore it down!? That's insane!		
I pave my own roads, yo. Now le's haul it!		
(The guy's a freakin' rhino. Doesn't he ever pace himself?)		
Aight! It's right through here. Move it, yo!		
WHAT'S right through here?		
Hey!!! Listen when people are talking to you...		
(This is the Shibuya River. Where Souvik wanted to go...)		
......		
! Hey! Another wa--		
Stupid @#!%(#^)^@^ WALL!		
Yeowwwch!		
Hey, take it easy!		
Yo, what the hell! I got the keypin right here! Why can't I break it?		
Keypin?		
Yeah, the Reapers got 'em to open each area.		
They have keys?		
How you think I opened that last wall?		
"Open"? I think you mean "smash."		
Openin' them takes too long! We got through, aight? Who cares how!		
Certainly not you.		
Sides, breakin' the walls feels better.		
This is nuts, dude. Keep it up, and you won't last out the mission!		
It don't matter, man. Arrrgh, what the hell! LET ME IN!		
...... Maybe you've got the wrong key.		
...... ...... ...... Dammit. I need another key?		
Look, let's give this up for now. 104's back the other way. We gotta		
Tsk, fine. Whatever!		
Hey... Wait up!!!		
Time's runnin' out! Haul it to 104!		
Conductor, sir. I've received word of another rebellion.		
......		
A new Reaper under special orders from you, sir. Name: Daisukenojo		
...Ah, yes. The boy.		
With your permission, sir, I'd like to handle him personally-- as 		
No, Konishi. You will remain on standby.		
To what end, sir?		
I need to discuss this with the Composer.		
Mr. Kitaniji, far be it from me to question you, but...the boy's 		
Ha ha! Konishi, talking back? Has hell frozen over? We mete out		
I... understand, sir. I'll stay my hand until the Composer has 		
That little goon! Even a chimp knows better than to pick the losing		
...... Want past this wall? Then take down these Noise!		
Damn, another wall...		
Heh! Them Noise is getting' a beatdown! Ready, Phones? Hope you can 		
Well, first you gotta tell me how you fight.		
That's easy. I just... ...... You know. It's like...um... Poker! Yeah!		
OK, makes sense. Sort of.		
You'll get it once we start fightin', yo! Le's do it!		
Right now!?		
Aight, le's mow 'em down!		
Ha! How ya like dat? Two cards on the ground, pick one up in the air, 		
That's... confusing.		
Well... un-fuse it! I can't figure it out, so you gotta!		
What? But it's your technique!		
I only know what I know 'cause... 'cause Rhyme explained it.		
Rhyme...		
...... Wanna pound stuff again?		
Heh heh! Aight, le's do it!		
Aight. Now you know how it's done.		
Objective met. Wall clear!		
Booya, we made it!		
Timer's gone. All clear.		
One day down, six more to go!		
First I have to ask you something.		
Like what, yo? Le's just play the Game.		
"Trust your partner." That's the key to survival here. So I gotta know:		
Yeah. So?		
Is that the only reason? I can't afford any surprises in this Game. Why		
What's a "jeppardy"?		
Huh?		
Look, man. I dunno your big words. But I do got another reason.		
OK. What?		
I wanna set Shibuya up widda new Composer. Me!		
I'm back, Konishi.		
Mr. Kitaniji. Have you made a decision?		
Yes. Strip the little rebel of his Reaperhood. Treat him as a Player		
Yes, sir.		
I needn't remind you, Konishi, of your obligation to erase both the		
I'll get the job done, sir.		
Good. But to be safe, I'm requiring all Reapers to wear their O-Pins.		
Outlet Pins? Sir, I know O-Pins enhance Reaper battle performance, 		
Nonetheless, the Composer wills it. I, for one, am grateful. Haven't 		
Yes, sir.		
I'm also putting the UG on Emergency Call.		
! Emergency Call!?		
Make the arrangements.		
...Right away. Something's wrong. Why such alarm over one artless		
Sensible, Senseless. Chapter Closed]		
Ready for Day 2?		
Mission's here.		
Hey! Ain't you down wid the plan?		
Yeah. Like we talked about yesterday. Ignore the missions and make for		
Once I'm Composer, this Game business is done! An' then... ...... Man,		
Go where? You haven't even read the mission.		
!		
Who'zat?		
Greetings. I am this week's Game Master, Mitsuki Konishi.		
Tsk... This is the Iron Maiden? Move, yo! I ain't got time for you!		
So primitive. You think I can't see what you're up to? You were		
So what, yo!? I'm a Reaper. I don't gotta do some stupid mission!		
...As I thought. Well, I regret to inform you you were officially		
Pfft. Whatever. You can't fire me, 'cause I quit, yo!		
Oh, don't act like a child.		
You think I'm actin'!?		
...No, I can see it comes quite naturally to you.		
Heh heh. Damn right!		
...... Uh, dude... She's making fun of you.		
WHAT!?		
Sigh... Since I can't reverse evolution and speak your language, 		
Yeah, so? Big deal, yo.		
You've earned 0 points. Not a very hard worker, I see.		
You was gonna make me sic Noise on the Players! That ain't what I		
......		
Then I can't fathom why you did. One person's success is built on		
Shut up! What do YOU know?		
As you wish. 0 points. That leaves you with about five days to live,		
What!?		
Five days?		
Then I ain't gonna last the Game...		
The Reapers' wings are not license to do whatever you please. Ponder		
!! What!? NO!		
I wonder what you hold dearest. Could it be... this Noise? It is,		
Give her back, you Iron Witch!		
Hmph. I have a better idea. Since this seems to be distracting		
NO! Don't you do it, yo!		
There. Much more manageable. Now you can focus on my mission.		
Why you... Gimme that pin!!!		
First, your mission. How about... "Defeat me. You have 6 days."		
DAYS?		
Or until you perish. Whichever comes first.		
Yo, I don't need no six days-- I'm gonna finish this right here an' 		
A predictably hasty response. ...Let me finish. Keep jumping the gun		
Dammit! That ain't fair...		
At this point, I am going to move to a certain place. I will stay in		
So it's like hide-and-seek.		
We just gotta find you? Tha's easy, yo.		
Correct. We call this Reaper Sport 2: "Hide-and-Seek." I picked		
Whatchu jus' say!?		
Best of luck to you. Oh, and here. You'll need this.		
A Player Pin...		
I'm looking forward to watching you squirm and choke-- powerless to		
Yo, get back here, dammit! Nngh!		
The timer.		
Dammit! She got away.		
That's the way to 104.		
Yo, forget the Shibuya River. We gotta go after her, man. I need that		
Wait, why? That Noise that was with you. What wa--		
That ain't no Noise, Phones!		
Huh?		
Le's bounce!		
Yo, she ran that way, Phones.		
Toward 104.		
Don't let her get away, yo!		
Damn, a wall... I'm gonna smash it, yo!		
Whoa, whoa!		
What, man?		
Ever think about conserving your energy? We don't need to		
Hey, that could be a trap, yo. You can't prove Ironface isn't		
Are you can't prove she is! Let's just start with the		
But we ain't got time for guessin'...		
Look, I get how you feel. But you're not a Reaper anymore. 		
Aight, MOM! Damn...		
Sooo... this is an O-Pin.		
Reminds me of the design sweeping the town. You know... I think it's		
Something about this stinks.		
Better hold your nose, then. We have to wear 'em. GM's orders.		
You mean her Iron Mugliness? She's really gone and done it this time.		
Oh, c'mon, live a little! Secret weapons? Unchained power? Sign me up!		
Uh-huh. Ever wonder why they keep the chains ON?		
I guess... it must take a toll.		
Something must be spooking the higher-ups if they're breakin' these		
It does seem like overkill for one little freshmeat traitor.		
Maybe. Maybe not.		
Huh? Please.		
Anyway, I see you've finally cheered up.		
Well, yeah? Work is finally getting back to normal. Rewarding! Hee 		
Atta girl! Now how 'bout a day for bowl of--		
Working diligently, I see.		
! Oh! Y-yes, ma'am!		
Tsk...		
Come on out, Ironface! Where you at!?		
Not here, that's for sure.		
Dammit, she gonna pay!		
Maybe she's somewhere up ahead. Let's keep looking.		
Another wall... End of the road.		
Naw, not this time, yo.		
Whoa, don't do anything crazy!		
Yo, quit bustin' my berries, man. I'm talkin' 'bout THIS. This wall 		
The one you used to "open" the wall yesterday?		
Heh heh. She forgot to take it back. There. Open. Le's move!		
Dammit... Where'd that Reaper tramp go?		
Got you now, traitor.		
Who the hell are you?		
A Reaper.		
Yeah, like we couldn't tell. Well, guess what. I'm a Player now. You		
What, didn't you get the memo? The UG's on Emergency Call.		
Pfft. What's the emergency?		
When the UG's continued existence is threatened, neutralization		
Sorry, man, but I don't speak geek.		
It means the ban on attacking Players has been lifted. You're		
Heh, good for you, yo. Take your best shot. But I'm tougher than you		
Not when I've got an O-Pin!		
"Oh pin"? Whassat?		
It makes me a dozen times more powerful than usual! Prepare to		
Bwaaah! Oh no you didn't! Now you askin' for it!		
H-how!? The pin didn't work?		
Heh. You all talk, man. It don't work 'cause you WEAK.		
I underestimated you, Daisukeno--		
Bwaaah! Dontchu say it!		
Die-sue-what?		
Forget it, yo. We got us a bigger problem.		
The Emergency Call... We're gonna have to fight off the Reapers now.		
Rrgh, dammit! Why they gotta get up in our grills when we busiest? 		
...... Uh, because you betrayed them?		
...... ...... ...... Bwaaah! You sayin' it's my fault? Well... we still		
Works for me.		
Aight, le's go find the Iron Maiden.		
(Hmm... That's weird, though. The GM could've just erased us. Why 		
Yo, le's move!		
All right!		
can I count on you, Mr. Kariya? Yashiro?		
Of course, ma'am! Special orders straight from the GM! We're honored.		
......		
You're officer material, Yashiro. Where points are concerned, you		
Yes, ma'am! Thank you for the advice.		
Show me some results, and I can guarantee a promotion. I'll speak to		
I won't let you down, ma'am!		
As for you, Mr. Kariya, you should already be--		
Picked a hiding place yet? Must be fun to run.		
"Run"? Oh, Mr. Kariya, you need to fix that erroneous assumption. I		
Hold it, renegade.		
Dammit... Reaper!		
Punk! Sow me whatchu got!		
Man, where they all comin' from? Tsk... Let's go.		
Hey! You see that?		
Wait up, Ironface!		
Durff! Stupid wall! Keypin, keypin. Got it, yo!		
C'mon!		
You ain't gettin' away, Ironface!		
She ran toward A-East.		
Aight, yo. Le's move it!		
Quit runnin', you coward!		
That's A-East...		
She's hidin' in the building, yo. This is our chance, Phones! Le's take		
Heh heh! We got her now, man. Ironface gotta be somewhere in		
Hey! You two! Perfect timing.		
Huh? Oh. It's you.		
Whatchu want, man? We're in a hurry!		
Yeah, we don't have time for you right now.		
Aw, that's too bad... for you.		
Yo, Whatchu say?		
...I am sooo on fire today! The bounty just fell right into my lap!		
Wait... You wouldn't!		
Hmph. You know we gonna crush you, Porcupine.		
Uhh... Don't count on it, bro. I've been on a lucky streak today. Tix to		
Yeah? Good for you, man. Go play wid your mic or somethin' and step off		
Sorry. Denied! Whatever you did to get a price put on your head, I 		
Like I'm the bad guy!		
You are to me. Now, Daisukenojo Bito, prepare to be face-melted!		
Bwaaah!		
Die...bee... What? Is that some kind of hex?		
Yo, don't you dare use that name!		
Name!? You don't mean...		
...... ...Yeah.		
Are you serious?		
I know it's lame, man. Jus' call me Beat!		
Let's rock, Daisukenojo!		
Bwaaah! You'll pay for that, yo!		
Damn... You guys are tough.		
Tha's right. Now call me Beat!		
(Is that all that matters to him?)		
That cost us time, yo. Le's keep movin'.		
Hey, hold up. Finish what you started... End me.		
End you? Yo, I didn't even wanna start you. And I ain't got nothin'		
Go rock out. You gonna let down your fans?		
...... Heh heh... Man, today IS my lucky day. Thanks, Phones. You, too,		
Bwaaah! Yo, you askin' for mo' pain!		
Hey! Calm down...		
Dai-- I mean Beat. Here. Take this.		
Whatchu givin' me, man?		
My keypin.		
Is that allowed?		
Doesn't matter. I don't like owin' people.		
Aight, then. Thanks, man. ...C'mon, Phones!		
Yeah, she couldn't've left the building.		
Who?		
The Iron Maiden!		
You mean Konishi?		
We saw the Game Master go in.		
What? Naw, you're mistaken. No one's inside the space. I would've seen 		
You didn't see her? (But she went right past him... Still, he doesn't		
Hey, anybody in here? I said, HEEEY!!! See? Nobody-- Gwaargh!		
! What happened?		
Quick, Phones!		
It's pitch black...		
Hey! Porcupine! You aight?		
...... Let's have a look around.		
Yo! Porcupine! You aight? What she do to you!?		
......		
Man... What the hell's goin' on?		
What's this?		
Looks like a dog collar.		
It's the choker 777 had on.		
Huh? Then what's it doin' here?		
...She erased him.		
What!? That lowdown, dirty... How could she do somethin' like that!?		
Hey, heads up! There's something in here!		
Tsk... Noise?		
We'll find her. But first, let's get rid of this!		
Hee hee hee...		
Hee hee hee...		
Show yourself, Ironface!		
She's in here somewhere. Keep looking!		
Style. Chapter Closed]		
...Huh? !? The scramble!?		
But we was just at A-East, yo! She dumped us back at the starting 		
Wait!		
What for!? We know where she's at!		
We know where she WAS. But we couldn't find her.		
Yeah, we did look pretty hard, but--		
We don't really have any proof she was really there.		
You heard her laughin' at us!		
It's possible that was all just a setup. Let's check some other places		
Aight. Fine. But it's Day 3, yo. I don't got much more time. This 		
Well, there is!		
!? Yo, who'zat?		
Like, take it down a notch, Freshmeat. Or should I call you 		
Whatchu want, Pinky?		
Hey, leave my hair out of this.		
(......)		
You here to take us out? If you gonna bring it, then bring it! We're in 		
?		
Oh yeah? You don't want THIS?		
!? That pin!		
The GM passed it on to me. She made me substitute GM for the day!		
Yo, gimme that back!		
Hooold on. This is your entry fee. You can't have it back unless you		
Bwaaah! Tha's right... Dammit!		
But how about we have a little bonus round? If you finish my mission,		
Yo, fo' real?		
Like, totally. I'm subbing for the GM. It's my call.		
And of course you'd never try to trick us.		
What? Oh, come on. You think this is all a ruse? Fine, I'll just 		
Wh-whoa! Don't!		
Ahh, now you believe me. So! Here's your mission.		
......		
We are going to play Reaper Sport 4:		
ACHOO! ACHOO!		
(Huh? What'd she say?)		
You have 60 minutes. Fail, and-- Well, I'm not an official proxy, so I		
Then why you think we gonna listen to you?		
I can't erase you... but I CAN erase this pin.		
What! You sneaky--		
Oh, get over it. Now... Ready, set... GO!		
Dammit! Get back here, Pinky!		
Hey, this could be our lucky break. It beats hunting after the real GM.		
Yeah... I guess. We don't need Ironface if we get the pin back. Yo, 		
Time's a wastin', man. Le's finish this mission!		
You said it.		
Hey, so, um... what's the goal for today's mission?		
Huh? Yo, weren't you listenin'?		
...... No. I couldn't hear 'cause you sneeze like a freakin' elephant.		
Man... Get wid it. Today's mission is-- ......		
...... You don't know.		
I-I got it, Phones! Just gimme a sec. Reaper Spurt 4, right?		
Sport.		
Right, Sport. Umm... Well RS 1 is "Russian Roulette." RS 2 is "Hide-		
Sigh... What should I do? Maybe it's time to break out Reaper		
Oh yeah! "Reaper Creeper"! That's what RS 4 is!		
...... You just pulled that out of thin air.		
Did not! Hey, I used to be a Reaper, yo! We cool.		
OK, so... how does RS 4: Reaper Creeper work?		
Well, you gotta act like the Reaper... and creep into people's heads 		
...Are you sure?		
Hey, I used to be a Reaper, yo! We cool.		
.......		
Aight, Phones. Le's find us some peeps to Creep.		
How 'bout the guy who just walked by?		
This is perfect, man. Le's have that guy do the Reaper 		
Phones! Where you goin'? We gotta Creep that guy over there.		
...... Is that really the mission?		
Hmm... Ever since discovering Reaper Creeper, I've let it make		
What? He ain't gonna do it?		
Weird, for him.		
Should I keep relying on this? ...... Of course! I'll just ask		
Yeah, pops! 'Atta boy...		
......		
Reaper... Creeperrraaargh! What am I doing? I have to quit cold		
Aw, quit jerkin' us around, pops! Hurry up and Creep!		
...Are you SURE this is what we have to do?		
Y-yeah! Reaper Spurt 4: "Reaper Creeper". I used to be a Reaper, yo!		
......		
Trust me, Phones. Now let's get that guy to-- Huh? Where'd he go?		
Sigh...		
Oh, crap! We gonna lose him! Book it, Phones!		
(Must...trust...partner...)		
Where'd that guy go, man? We need him to play Reaper Creeper.		
...... Well, for now, let's check the other areas.		
Got you now, traitor.		
Damn, again!?		
Your time is up.		
Yo, they do't take a hint. How many asses we gotta kick, man?		
Quit moaning about it. C'mon.		
Hey! There he is!		
Sigh...		
Tee hee!		
Huh? You see Pinky jus' go by?		
Yeah. She was giggling. What's up with that?		
Yo, Phones! We gotta chase after that guy!		
Right, but... (the Reaper. What the heck is she doing?)		
Yo, Phones! The Reaper Creeper guy went down... uhmmm... Mo'		
"Mo' People Street"? Is that Beat-speak for Center Street?		
Dammit, where'd he go now?		
Tee hee!		
Hey. There goes the Reaper again.		
What, Pinky?		
Yeah. She just took off. You didn't see her?		
Yo, are we lookin' for the guy or not?		
...... I dunno. I think she's acting weird. Like she's teasing us.		
Whatever, man.		
You sure today's mission is--		
ACHOO! ACHOO!		
......		
Ahhh. Got the sniffles. Aight, le's go, Phones! We gotta track down 		
......		
Sigh...		
Yo, Phones! There he is!		
Sigh...		
Huh? What's he doing here?		
Sigh...		
! M...Makoto!		
Oh! Boss...		
Yo, man. This could be our chance.		
Yeah. Let's see what he's up to.		
Phones! The guy was over by Tipsy Tose Hall. Le's get him to		
Huh? Watchu all want?		
You're just in time. We were about to play		
If you win, we'll give you a rare pin.		
Yo, whatchu wanna do? You playin'?		
Really? That's too bad.		
Here for Tin Pin?		
All right! Let's play. But careful: we're good.		
Ha ha ha! You've got a ways to go.		
Come back when you're ready.		
Hmph...		
Hey, not bad!		
That was fun. Let's play again sometime!		
Boss, how have you been?		
Fit as a fiddle, thanks.		
Sorry you had to see me like this.		
Is that new business not panning out?		
I just don't have the knack for it. I made this big show about

Oh, Makoto...		
Heh, I'm sorry. That's not a very fair question after what I did to

Damn right, pops! He's gonna do it, Phones! Now's our turn to Creep, 		
Hmm... (I dunno... This seems too important to leave up to some game.)		
Do it, Phones!		
No. Not this time.		
Huh? Watchu talkin' about, Phones?		
He needs to find the words himself.		
But Phones...		
Gaaah! It's not moving! Please! Creep to me, Reaper!		
Hey, Boss, look... I gotta take off.		
W-wait, Makoto!		
Huh?		
Do you... remember when you first started with me? On your

Makoto! Back then, you had your head stuck so far up in the

Not quite. The you I knew first? He didn't need fancy clothes

I think you need to search back and ask THAT person where you		
Wow... ...... All this time I've been rushing into things. Maybe I		
No, I should be thinking you.		
Huh? For what?		
Nothing, nothing.		
Hey, Boss. I gotta get going.		
All right. SHow the world what you've got!		
Heh heh. Who needs some piece of paper? My own answers beat the		
Damn straight, pops. ...Hey, wait a minute. BWAAAH! Phones, you've 		
...... About this "Reaper Creeper" business... I gotta ask you.		
What, yo?		
Is that REALLY today's mission?		
Yo, I told you--		
I don't think you remember.		
I do! Like I said, I Reaper Spurt 4--		
It's SPORT.		
Hrrrm... ...... Sorry, Phones. It's been two days since I was a Reaper. 		
(Um...Two days isn't that long. ) Look, next time just be up-front 		
Man... Why I gotta be like this? I never change.		
......		
You know Rhyme? She used to say the same stuff-- like a hundred times,		
Beat... I don't trust that pink-haired lady. Why she said doesn't add		
We ain't got time for salt!		
We don't have time for mistakes, either. Slow and steady wins the 		
I'm telling you, Beat. We need to find the golden bat.		
We ain't got time for bats!		
We don't have time for mistakes, either. Haste makes waste!		
She always had some saying. And she knew to think ahead! But me... I		
......		
I know I gotta think things through. I really do, man. But I freak out		
Brother? Wait, Rhyme's your sister?		
What, didn't I mention? Yeah. We from the same family.		
Whoa! (I had no idea.)		
We came to the UG together, partnered up... and then I... I...		
Hey, you didn't do anything!		
It's like I killed her, man. You don't know the half of it.		
Beat...		
Why I gotta be so stupid? I thought I could bring Rhyme back by

When Rhyme got erased, Hanekoma gathered up her soul and stored it in a

I was lookin' for a way to turn her back to normal, but I didn't find		
Is that how it works?		
Yup. And once I'm in charge of Shibuya, I can fix Rhyme. I owe her a

Listen up, Phones, 'cause I'm only gonna say this once.		
What?		
Help me... You gotta help me save her. I ain't that smart. I just crash		
...... Screw you.		
What!?		
Don't be an ass. She's my friend. And you act like I'd mind saving her.		
Don't sweat it, man! I'll bring you all back to life, soon as I'm in		
All right.		
Yo, uh... thanks, Phones.		
Hey, not necessary. Like Mr. H said: "Trust your partner."		
Heh heh! True dat.		
So what's today's REAL mission?		
...... Well...first le's track Pinky down.		
So that Noise was Rhyme...		
Tha's right. So we gotta find that Reaper

Ugh, what's with you losers!?

Don't you want to win at ALL!? I oughta crush this pin! I swear, if 		
Huh? Tag? Wait, so Reaper Sport 4--		
It's "Tag," you dolt! Didn't they teach you anything at all? That's 		
Tag.		
Huh?		
You're it.		
What!?		
Bwa ha ha! You see how stupid she is? She just walked right up to us		
That...that last tag doesn't count! And did you just call me stupid?		
Yo, you are! I ain't never seen no one suck so bad at tag.		
Shut up shut up shut up! You have no right to call anyone stupid!		
We cleared your mission, Pinky. Now hand over the pin!		
I...I've got another mission for you! "Defeat the pissed off Reaper!"		
Hey, play fair!		
I have to win this Game. I don't care what it takes! Now bring it, you		
Look out, yo! One more punch and you gone! Hand over the pin an' I 		
AAAaaaAAAAAAaaaRRRRRRrrrRRRrrrGGGGgggGGH!!! Take your mercy and shove		
Hey! Enough is--		
I WANT MY PROMOTION! I'm not shooting for any Miss Nice awards!		
Aw, now girl... 		
!		
Face the facts. They got you whupped.		
Oh, be quiet! You can underachieve all you want. But I want to move 		
Up, up, up, and then what?		
Well... I-I-I--		
Don't know? Then don't bother. Shooting for nothing sounds crazy to		
Then what about you! Why'd you turn your promotion down?		
......		
Yeah, I know about it. They were gonna make you an officer. And you		
...... Being an officer sucks. Why join the brass and strut around		
......		
Sides, if I join the officers, how am I gonna sucker you into buyin'		
...Jerk. ...... Well... I guess I can stay in the audience a bit		
Yeah, girl. Stop and smell those concrete roses. Now then. Sorry to		
A Lv. 3 keypin? Yo, you can keep this. Gimme Rhyme!		
No can do. I haven't had my fun yet.

Um, villain? Screwin' with you is my job. But you have my word. Beat 		
You swear this time?		
On my life. ...Wait, that doesn't work. Anyway, I won't be pulling

So it seems. Weird place to start the day, huh?

AAAAAAIIIGHT!		
Whoa, what was that for?		
Time to give Lollipop a lickin' and get Rhyme back, yo!		
Yeah... You said it. From the way Lollipop-- wait, Kariya, was it? The		
Yeah, jus' be ready, Phones. Lollipop's one tough customer.		
Oh, come on. He's just another Reaper. I've already beat two Game		
Naw, man, Kariya's skills put the brass to shame. He's only a small fry		
Yeah, they were talking about that.		
Trus' me, he ain't' gonna mess up like Pinky did, yo.		
...... Wait, are YOU worrying about ME?		
Huh!?		
Who are you and what have you done with Beat?		
N-naw, man! I was jus' sayin' we gotta be vegetant! We after the		
Vigilant. And is the Composer that strong?		
He's gotta be, right? How else he gonna keep sly punks like Shades in		
It won't be that easy.		
Well, you better man up, yo, cause we gotta find Lollipop. Le's start

Oof! Oww, dammit! Freakin' wall... Now where's that keypin? Whaaa?		
Gone!? Then we're trapped in here?		
...Tsk. Here, of all places...		
What do you mean?		
N-nothin', aight?		
...... Crap. This complicates things. How do we open the walls without		
Yo, you know when I woke up, this was lyin' next to me.		
...... Well, thanks for mentioning. What is it? A box? What's inside?		
I couldn't get it open, man. I tried smackin' the button on top, but--		
Are you crazy? What if it was a trap?		
...... Yo, you show me a button, and I wanna push it. Aight?		
I think they design traps like this with you in mind.		
Sh-shut up, yo! Leas' we know the button don't work. Press it an' this		
Oh yeah?		
WRONG! Layout reset.		
Now what does that mean?		
Hmm? We got mail, yo. "See you at Towa Records. Key's in the box." This		
It's from Kariya. So the keypin is in this box?		
That sneaky bastard. How we supposed to open it?		
...... If the box says "wrong" then there must be a "right." (We need a		
Yeah, they was lyin' all over the place.		
Let's check it out.		
I'll hang on to the box, yo. You tell me when to push the button,

Sup with this piece a' paper, yo?		
Are these markings supposed to be Noise?		
This star symbol looks familiar, yo.		
Yeah, 'cause it's on that box of yours.		
Whoa! You're right.		
Think there's a connection?		
You see this piece a' paper, man?		
Figure that mark is a Noise?		
There's a picture of a moon, too.		
What does it mean?		
Yo, check this piece a' paper.		
These markings look like Noise.		
There's a picture of a sun, too.		
What does it mean?		
Ooh! Lemme guess! Is it...push time?		
......		
Aww, no push?		
I don't think we have the right answer yet.		
You sure you aint just scared, man?		
...... (Talk about projection...)		
OK... Here goes, yo! Careful when you push it!		
(...Me?)		
WRONG! Layout reset.		
Bwaaah! Whatchu playin' at, Phones!?

Don't go pushin' the button widdout thinkin'. Be smart!		
(That, coming from you?)		
CORRECT! Box unlocked.		
Booya! We did it, Phones!		
(... "We"?) OK, box's unlocked.		
I'll take it from here, yo!		
......		
Sweet! A keypin!		
OK! Let's hurry to Towa Records!		
Dammit... Not yet, man. This is a Lv. 1 keypin. It won't open the way 		
Well, no point in staying here. Let's see what we can find over that

Uh-huh. Lead the way...

H-hey, reel it in! He's already said he's over by the record store.		
Whatever, yo. He can hear me. I shout loud! Rrgh... C'mon, I can't 		
I know! Settle down. (What's got him so upset today? Did something		
! Yo! Phones! I see somethin' over there!		
OK. Let's check it out.		
What have we here?		
Anotha' box?		
Again?		
Yo, I call Box Holder! Jus' say when you wanna push the button.		
(...Right.)		
You see this piece a' paper, man?		
This mark here must represent Noise.		
There's a picture of a moon, too.		
Just like our new box.		
Ooh! You solve it?		
......		
Sure you got it right, man?		
...... (You tell me, genius. )		
CORRECT! Box unlocked.		
Hey! Very imprecious, Phones!		
(Rhyme must have had her hands full...) OK, box's unlocked. Let's open 		
I got this, yo!		
......		
Bwaaah!		
What?		
There's a box in the box! Man, I'm sick a' rackin' my brain...		
(He's actually been... THINKING?)		
Aight, your turn, Phones. I'll watch the box!		
......		
Yo, check this piece a' paper.		
These markings must be Noise.		
There's a picture of a sun, too.		
Just like our new box.		
Ooh! You solve it?		
......		
Sure you got it, man?		
...... (Help, if you're that worried!)		
CORRECT! Box unlocked.		
Wow, Phones. That was spesticular!		
(Rhyme DID have her hands full... Very full.) OK, box's unlocked. Let's		
I got this, yo!		
......		
Booyaka! Another keypin! Now we can get to Towa Records!		
All right. Let's hurry! But still... You have to wonder. Why would

All right. Open it up. ...... Hey, you got the keyp-- Huh? Where...		
......		
(What's he doing?)		
Hey, man, what's wrong?		
This is where...		
Flowers... Was there an accident here? (An accident! ......)		
...... ......		
!? Hey, whoa! Tears? Seriously... Who are you and what have you done 		
This is where... where me an' Rhyme died.		
Here?		
That morning' me an' my folks had it out. Jus' like always, I took off.		
......		
I jumped in front of her, but... I ain't strong enough to stop a car, 		
I'm...I'm really sorry, man.		
I killed her. I stole her future... ya know? Rhyme wasn't a loser like		
But c'mon, man. You know she didn't hold it against you.		
I'll never know.		
...Huh? But you two got along great!		
Yeah, she never blamed me.		
See?		
LISTEN! She... She didn't remember, yo.		
Like, her memory was gone?		
I dunno. But when we woke up in the UG, an' whatchu think she said to 		
So they took her memory... Like they did with me.		
Prob'ly. But she didn't win the Game. So even if I become Composer an'		
That's terrible...		
It's what it is. But I don't care! I'm still gonna bring her back!		
I'm with you, man.		
Thanks. ...... Sorry, I'm wastin' time. We...we gotta get over to Towa		
Here goes. Aight, it's open. Le's go, Phones.		
OK.		
Where you at!? Come on out!		
Is he even here?		
Tsk... Fool's prob'ly hidin' somewhere. Yo, what if we scan for him?		
You can't scan Reapers.		
No, but we might find anotha' clue!		
...... All right.		
Yo, Phones, hold up! Lollipop said he's here, right? Le's 		
That's odd...		
Huh? Wassup?		
I can't scan!		
What? That's wack, man! Try again.		
(......) I'm serious! It's not working.		
No way! Why not!?		
(Good question.)		
So this means... what? Everybody's a Reaper?		
C'mon, please. You see any wings? And if they were Reapers, they'd 		
Aight... so then what, yo?		
! Hey, look! Red Skull pins.		
Yeah, all the people's got 'em...		
Wait! What if it's the pins? Maybe they block my scan, like the Player		
Could be, yo. Rhyme said Players can't scan each other.		
Or technically people carrying Player Pins. It's like the pin blocks		
So these people is all Players? I mean, if they got pins, yo...		
No, we're the only two Players. I'm sure of it. These people are alive-		
Naw, they can't play the Game if they alive. THINK, man!		
We can't all be great thinkers like you.		
So, yo, the Red Skull pins-- they a CAT design, right?		
Wow, you know CAT?		
Hells yeah, I ain't stupid. Everybody in Shibuya knows CAT! The two 		
They do.		
It can't be a coincidence. The same guy musta made both, yo.		
......		
So that means... he's also gotta be... uhhhhhhhhhmmmmmmmm ...meh.		
Riiight. How 'bout we go get Rhyme?		
Oh! Good call! Lollipop is waitin'!		
...... (...Naw, that's ridiculous. It can't be him...)		
Oh, here already?		
!?		
That was fast.		
Yo, shut up! You done sayin' your prayers?		
Still a ball of energy, I see. Fine. Make me do some work, why don't		
Here he comes...		
Phones, careful. He's--		
What? Do I detect WORRY?		
Huh!?		
Who are you and what have--		
I'm right here, man. Quit that! I'm jus' tellin' you not to screw up, 		
Tsk, tsk. Squabbling? You won't beat me like that. Come on. What are 		
You heard him, Phones! It's time for a throw down!		
I'm ready!		
Ooh, very good.		
Ha! Eat that! Betchu had enough!		
...... What can I say? I know when I'm beat. You win. Here's your pin		
What are you DOING?		
!		
Ugh, Kariya! You lazy bum. Who said you could call it a day? Now look		
Uzuki! What are you doing here?		
I came to see if you were goofing off. And it's a good thing.		
Oh, do you have to be such a drudge?		
Hey, who told me to put my heart into my work? Now you're gonna have 		
Tha's perfect, yo. We'll take both you and Lollipop at once! How many		
Aight, Uzuki. One more fight. If I have to.		
You have to. I'll buy you a bowl of ramen later.		
Bravo! You got us. A big hand for the winners. As promised, your pin.		
Yoink! Hang in there, Rhyme. I'll fix you right-- !? Hey... What are 		
Huh!?		
This pin's a fake!		
You dirty, lying cheaters!		
Damn! I KNEW I couldn't trust her. Hoodwinked again!		
Kariya, what are you talking about?		
The Iron Maiden gave us a fake on purpose.		
What!? Then where's the real pin?		
Where do you think?		
She lied to us!? Then my promotion... All of it...		
Beat, I don't know what to say.		
It's aight. Betchu ain't never even seen the real pin. How would you		
That's no excuse. I should've seen through the trick. Here. It won't		
A Lv. 4 keypin? What's this for, man?		
For everything. Right now... the UG needs you two to have this.		
(The UG needs us? Why?)		
Aight, man. I know what to do.		
(You... you do!?)		
C'mon, Phones! Oh, yo, 'fore I forget.		
Hmm?		
Watch your backs.		
And why would we need to do that?		
The last Reaper to give us a keypin got erased. We think the GM was		
Dontchu go bein' the next, aight?		
Aight. Thanks for the advice. We can take care of ourselves. Right,		
Hmph. They can mind their own business. Go on, scram...before I get		
Huh? Somethin' happened yesterday? I can't remember a thing! C'mon,		
Right. We've got a Game Master to find.		
...Face it, she just used us to stall for time. Kiss that promotion 		
Never.		
Huh?		
I won't give up. Not now. Don't you see how messed up this all is?		
Ugh-ier than it was back in the day, I'll give you that.		
Kariya... I love this town just as much as you. So I've decided. I		
My, oh my. That certainly sounds epic. Well, you let me know how that		
Ha ha. Nice try. You get to be my little helper.		
Bleh! Since when?		
Together we can move up the ladder--really change things!		
A happier Shibuya for all Reapers. It does have a nice ring to it...		
Anyway... I'm whipped for the day. Fat lot of good these O-Pins did		
You mean these? They're toys. They don't do anything.		
No way... Duds?		
Something, anyway. Now how 'bout that ramen? I'm ready to--		
Those kids. They're fugitives. Enough to warrant an EC. Why'd you let		
...... Uzuki, don't you feel it?		
Feel what?		
Shibuya's breaking.		
Breaking? Don't be so dramatic.		
The town's... homogenizing. Turning simple.		
Hmm, now that you mention it... The usual cacophony of thoughts has		
Yeah. Because they're changing, focusing-- all on a single point.		
You think it's an omen?		
Dunno. I just hope that point isn't a period, The End.		
Ungh... ahh...ahhhhhh...		
Uzuki?		
Aaaaaaugh!!!		
Hey, Uzuki, what's wrong! Nnngh! My... my head...		
Hmm, that took a while. Longer than I assumed. Hmph! This body 		
Indelible Guilt. Chapter Closed]

Relax. We've still got three days.		
We ONLY got three days, yo! An' I got less than you, remember? We ain't		
...... Well, one thing at a time. First: calm down.		
Aight! Fine.		
That Lv. 4 keypin we got yesterday-- what does it open?		
Kariya's key? Udagawa.

Take it easy! You're just gonna tire yourself out.		
Like I care, yo! Shoutin' is the only thing keepin' me calm!		
You always run on full blast, huh?		
Not even close, man. Only since comin' to the UG.		
Yeah?		
When I was alive, I took everythin' at my own pace.		
YOU?		
Yeah. I wasn't crazy about nothin'. Tha's why my folks always bitched		
Yeah... I think I do.		
They kept expectin' stuff I ain't got, then made me feel like trash 		
......		
So I quit tryin' altogether. Give up on myself, so my folks would, too.		
...... But you've GOT a dream. Rhyme said you wanted to be world's best		
That was all jus' made-up, man.		
Made-up? Why would you--		
Rhyme was beatin' herself up. Said she had no dreams. "Why come back to

I realized somethin' then. Rhyme's all I got left. So I said to myself, 		
Beat... You're definitely an idiot. A huge idiot.

I'm sorry about Rhyme. But what's done is done. Focus on the now. She

Yeah?		
Let's go see Mr. Hanekoma.		
Where-- Oh! Duh! Cat Street.		
We haven't looked around there yet.

Oh, hello... I'm sorry, we're not open yet. Oh! I know you.		
Yeah... sort of? (He remembers me?)		
Circumstances forced me to close shop for a while. But		
(Whoa! This guy is a chameleon...)		
What?		
Whoa, man. An' I thought the last one was busted up.		
Whoever it was headed for Cat Street.		
Then it musta been the H-Man. ...Returnin' to his lair!		
Look, stop imagining things. It's pointless. Once we talk to him, this

What the hell!?		
Who redecorated? This place is trashed, yo. You think Coffee Man did		
Why would he wreck his own shop? Maybe he was attacked.		
Man, I don't get none a' this!		
This place is deserted...		
I'm so sick a' this! I mean, what's goin' on, yo?		
The wall-breaker was after Mr. H.		
Ironface? You think she smashed it up?		
No. She said she would stay in one place all week. If she was here, she		
Who, then?		
You got me. Somebody else.		
Yo, we need to find a clue.		
...... Of course! The camera!		
What, that thing you used yesterday? What is it?		
It lets me take pictures of the past.		
Whoa! Tha's badass, man!		
...... (Two days ago, the Miyashita Park wall was still up. Which means		
Yo, lemme snap somethin'!		
! Huh? Hey-- Wait, don't-- STOP!		
Huh? Yo, Acro. I think it's broken.		
...... The camera only works three times a day.		
Huh? Wait, so that means--		
Three pictures a day.		
Bwaaah! Say somethin' sooner, man!		
Yeah, 'cause I had all that time to react.		
Maaan... I didn't get nothin'. What a waste of-- WHOA! Yo, Acro, check		
Hey, that's... Mr. H.		
What's he doin'? Hidin' somethin'?		
Let's check over there.		
Yo, it's a keypin!		
A keypin? For what?		
I ain't never seen this one before, man.		
Well, we've already checked everywhere... except one place! The Shibuya

What's up?		
The hell is that heap of garbage!?		
Heap? ...No!		
Yo, man, wha' that trash heap?		
It looks like one of... No way!		
What's this junk doing back--

The attack I used erased me, yes...		
(But you're back...)		
But I was refactored, through the refinery sigil, into...this! 		
So YOU made those burn marks.		
And now, this number-cruncher is back... with power that rivals

Wait... You went to WildKat!		
Yeah. That set was empty, though. Rrgh... Where'd he run off to?		
We have no idea!		
In that case... who needs you? Attention, 000s! It's time for you		
Nggh... The hell does this guy eat? He's so powerful!

Don't worry. He doesn't know where "there" is. Besides, we've got the

Well, we better deal. He said his power rivals the Composer's. What 		
Yo, that's nuts. ...You really think he's that tough? We better be able		
You gonna give up if we can't?

No way, man... You sayin' that guy made a Tabooty call? Then he knows 		
Calm down. First we have to find the GM. If we don't save Rhyme--		
I know! Ironface... We gotta find Ironface!		
(Not much of a river... Still, Souvik was bent on coming here. To see

Yeah.		
C'mon, man! Le's get fired up!		
OK. First, let's take out the GM and get Rhyme back. After

I dunno.

Yeah.		
Sooo zetta slow!		
!? Y-you!		
What the factor took so long?		
It's Tabooty!

You zetta morons! You haven't noticed? She's been with you...		
...The whooole time.		
!?		
Behind you!		
You you you you you you was hidin' in my shadow!?		
I didn't expect to have to reveal myself like this. By my forecasts,		
Heh! I'm only here 'cause your barrier's blocking me out.		
Unforeseen circumstances aside... my plans are proceeding without a

Hey, who gives a digit? Hurry up and open this barrier before I		
All right. I'll remove the barrier...under one condition.		
Yeah? What're you scheming this time?		
When you become Composer... I want you to make me your Conductor.		
Heh! You're double-crossing Megs?		
Analysis shows that Shibuya is heading toward an untimely end. If		
Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally! I zetta dig your style! You and		
Then I'll take care of the barrier.		
Attention, binomials of the UG! Introducing your new Composer...		
Yo, where you think you goin'!?		
Ah ah ahhh. I'm afraid I can't let you take one step further.		
You'd betray the Composer?		
Betray? I simply choose to align with the man in charge. It hardly		
What?		
As far as I'm concerned, anyone could be the Composer. Suppose		
So everybody's jus' a pawn to you.		
NO matter how this ends, I will be Conductor.		
Scheming witch...		
When the Composer started requiring O-Pins, I knew the UG revolution		
Then what's going IS his fault.		
I don't presume to know the Composer's true intentions. But I intend		
! (She chucked the pin?)		
These "O-Pins"... They're fakes. Wear them, and you're finished.		
(I knew it...)		
I have a better pin in my deck.

Please. Spare yourself the embarrassment. My analyses are never

Me? Work for you? Hee hee... Ha ha ha ha! You vexatious monkey!		
Heh heh. Damn right!		
Uh, dude... She's making fun of you.		
WHAT!?		
It's YOUR fault I didn't pick up on Shibuya's changes sooner!		
You so busy thinkin' wid your head, you forgot to pay attention wid

Heh. Aight, man, you said it. Then le's do this thing!		
How... An error in my analysis? Impossible...		
Sucks for you.		
How could you have risen above my projections? You're not a Reaper!

What...		
Hee hee... That look on your face. It's just...as I pre...dicted...		
Rhyme's memories of me was MY entry fee? Then what was hers, yo? ......		
Right.		
Huh? Mail...		
From who?		
"See you in the Composer's chamber."		
Yo... You think it's...		
...... (Mr. H?)		
Yo, Acro! Le's move!		
Right...		
Hang on, Rhyme... I'm almost there...		
......		
Acro! Keep movin'!		
All right!		
The Composer must be ahead. Once we go on, I don't think we can come		
Well, I ain't sittin' out here. You ready, man?		
Well, aight. But don't take too long, yo.		
Good to go, man?		
Aight! Full speed ahead!		
! Wait!		
Wha's wrong, yo?		
Behind us... Something's coming.		
Ohhh... What is this place? It's so dark...and spooky... And stinky.		
Shiki... Shiki!!!		
Whoa! Acro? Beat!?		
What are you doing here!?		
I woke up here all by myself.		
Yo, does that mean we won the Game? Like, the Iron Maiden was the las'		
(But if I won the Game, why hasn't Shiki come back to life? Did the		
So where are we? Are we all alive again?		
No, not yet. This is the Shibuya River... in the UG.		
The UG? But why!? I'm supposed to be alive...		
...You can blame me. They made you my entry fee. I'm sorry...		
Huh? I was your entry fee? Then... ! Wh-whoa! So I'm your... I'm		
That's 'cause you haven't seen me in two weeks. You missed a lot. And I		
Well... Look on the bright side. If we're together now, you must've		
Not yet.		
What? Why not?		
We beat the Game Master. But I haven't been taken to that white room.		
Prob'ly 'cause we been breakin' rules left an' right.		
I'm pretty sure the Game is null and void.		
Null and-- But what about our lives!?		
There still might be a way, yo-- if I become the next Composer!		
How does that work?		
I gotta take down the guy with the job now.		
Hmm... I see.		
You don't seem surprised.		
Not really. You both look so serious.		
......		
So I guess that must be the only way.		
Don't worry, yo! I'ma pull this thing off!		
I know, Beat. Let's not waste any time, then!		
(If the Composer stands between me and life... then he has to go. I...I		
Acro, let's go!		
Yeah, coming...		
The Composer's really strong, right?		
Yeah. But we still have to do this.		
I know! Good thing we have each other.		
You said it, yo. Together we gonna take back our lives.		
C'mon!		
! Look! There's something there.		
One of Pi-Face's heaps?		
Le's check it out.		
That junk heap...		
Let's check it out.		
Yo, Acro! Le's check that garbage heap.		
Omigosh! There's a person under there!		
Yo, look who it is!		
The Grim Heaper got... crunched.		
No way, man... This guy was tough as bricks! Who coulda done this to 		
I dunno. But whoever it was must have been more powerful.		
But, like... yo! We lucky, right?		
Don't be so morbid!		
But we don't gotta beat him now!		
No. Just the other guy who's stronger.		
Details, yo. I'm tellin' ya, we lucky!		
......		
Now le's keep goin'!		
What happened here?		
(And Pi-Face was so strong...)		
We're close, I can feel it. You ready?		
The Beat-wagon's always ready, yo!		
(Talking about it won't get it done.) Let's go!		
Whew... This door just screams "endgame."		
We almost there, Rhyme. Hang on jus' a little longer.		
......		
Acro, you all right? You look pale.		
....I'll be OK. Come on.		
Is this the Composer's pad?		
Wait... I know this place....		
Wow...		
What's a ritzy pad like this doing here?		
Yo! We got company!		
Welcome, Players. 		
!?		
Ex-Players, that is. Your Game has ended. Now you are simply Dead.		
It's him...		
Whatchu doin' here, Shades!?		
Where's the Composer?		
Oh, is that why you're here? And why would you kids want to meet the		
Whatchu think, man? We gonna take him down!		
Not a chance. You're not even fit to look upon Him.		
Whatchu say?		
The Composer's utmost concern is mankind's happiness. He exists to		
Yo, I don't get a word you sayin', but you ain't stoppin' me! I'm gonna		
You see! That self-serving rubbish is the root of all pain!		
What?		
Egotism-- disregard for others-- has caused Shibuya's downfall. And		
Nngh...		
!?		
Gahhh!		
Shiki?		
......		
She's not answering...		
You bastard! What did you do to Shiki?		
Got him!		
I see now why He picked you... Unnngh...		
Aight, yo! Composer's next!		
But Shiki--Nngh!		
Wh-what the hell?		
......		
Shiki? Damn... She don't recognize us!		
Why can't she-- (Wait. She has one on, too. If I break it...)		
It's no good, man! Girl be tryin' to kills us! We outta options. 		
Stop! Don't you touch her!		
Stupid... Behind you!		
Huff...huff... That should... stop Shiki... I was right. It was the

This graffiti... (I remember, Mr. H. Your art kept me going. Every 		
(Shiki... Beat... Souvik... Rhyme... Everybody. They got me this far.		
This place... Come on out, Composer! Fight me! You want me to defeat 		
Who's Mr. H?		
!? You again! But I just beat you!		
Ha ha ha ha! I'm amazed! Here you stand on the final stage-- and		
What do you mean...		
All right. You want answers? First off, the Composer is not the man 		
......		
I have been in charge of the UG since his departure.		
Mr. Hanekoma's... not the Composer? Then you're responsible...		
For many things, yes.		
Why... Why would you do this to Shibuya?		
Oh, Acro... Don't you like music?		
Huh?		
Music requires many things. Melody, performers, instruments... But 		
One ideal?		
Didn't you feel it in Shibuya? Rage. Hate. Misery. Envy. Fear.		
"Ills"?		
By tearing down the differences between us, I can make the world a		
By making everybody think alike? That's not even pos--		
It IS possible! With these pins.		
The Red Skull pins. You're behind that, too!?		
I based them on the Composer's Player Pin. You see, the eyes of the		
Huh?		
It neutralizes the effects of the Red Skull pin, so my imprinting 		
(This pin protects me? All this time, it was...)		
What have your dealings with other people brought you? Only hurt.		
......		
Join me. Help me build a new Shibuya.		
Not too long ago, I might have agreed. But not now. I've 		
I'll never help you! Maybe living in your Shibuya WOULD be easier.		
Then let me ask you this...Do you like people?		
...I see. Hmph. Why you would is beyond me... I think you need to be		
...... I see... I think you need to be reformed.		
Rrgh...		
Save your energy. An unpartnered Player has little to no power. You		
I... I can't move!		
Remember that I'm saving you. This pin was standing between you and		
DON'T!!!		
Welcome to the new Shibuya.		
...... ...... Nothing happened!		
Wh-what!? But I destroyed your Player Pin! Why can't I imprint on		
Whose "pick"?		
I owe you no more explanations! Only destruction!		
Yo yo yo, I don't think so! Ain't you forgettin' somebody? Here comes 		
Huh? Beat! Shiki!		
I told you, yo. Ain't no one gonna be the Composer but me!		
How could you go on without us, Acro? We're your partners! Now what 		
Um... trust 'em?		
That's better!		
Yo, forget this "partner" crap. You ain't my partner anymore, man. 		
Beat...		
C'mon, Acro. We've still got work to do!		
Yeah... Mr. Ringleader here...		
We jus' gotta take out Shades, right?		
Right.		
The three of us can do it! Now let's take our lives back!		
Right! Get him!		
I'm this close... Once I erase these three, Shibuya will be saved...		
No... I must keep fighting... My time is... almost up...		
I'm back, Megumi.		
!? J-J-J...		
Your timer must be nearly ticked out.		
Souvik!? You're alive! But why are you here?		
No, Sir! I'm not done, not yet! I WILL protect Shibuya!		
Hee hee... It seems I've won.		
NOOOOOO!!! It can't end like this... Who else will protect Shibuya?		
!? A timer!? Why does HE have a timer?		
Then... You'll do as You intended?		
End... Shibuya? But Composer...Sir! Why!?		
I've decided to wash my hands of it. It has no future value to me or		
Wait, Sir! Shibuya is still full of so many possibilities!		
Yes, and people too dull and clouded to see them. Shibuya's influence		
Then...the problem is the people? If they changed to something more		
Yes, but that's clearly beyond them.		
Sir...give me a chance to prove You wrong. I swear I'll remake		
...... A Game, then.		
THE Game?		
That's right. The rules will be simple. If you manage to fix Shibuya,		
...And if I can't fix it?		
Then you lose, Megumi. You and Shibuya will be erased.		
...That's all right. If I can risk my life to protect Shibuya, I 		
Relax, Megumi. I'll be sure to handicap myself. I'll retreat to the 		
Very well, Sir. I'll enter Your Game.		
Then first I'll need to collect your entry fee. You have one month,		
You're going to erase it... The streets I know and love, gone...		
You did well, Megumi. That was one of my more enjoyable Games.		
I gave it my all, Sir. I have no regrets.		
You know, I liked your idea. Shame it didn't work out.		
You gave me a wonderful opportunity. Thank You, Sir.		
As for you... Well played, Player. I still can't fathom why		
Me neither... Wait! That's right!		
Another Player Pin!? Why do you have two? I only gave you		
Huh? Souvik? What's going on?		
All of this was a Game-- one set up by me.		
What? Then that means you're--		
Let me make it obvious. Hmm... I suppose they'll serve.		
Wh-what's happening?		
I can't... move...yo...		
Shiki? Beat!?		
Hee hee... It was me, Acro. I'm Shibuya's Composer.		
What? But that... can't be...		
I know that must unsettle you. Especially since we spent all that		
Then everything I've one... All of it...		
Mm-hmm. You were playing for my team. Really, you did a bang-up job. 		
Then... What have I done!?		
I had one role in this Game: picking the Player who would play for		
...Me?		
Very sharp, Acro! Give yourself a hand. I knew I picked a winner.		
But it was Pi-Face that killed me...		
His bullet was meant for me. For some time now he's been after my		
Then you're the one who beat him?		
Why, yes! You're just sharp as a tack, Acro. Anyway, the pest 		
!!Into the RG? Wait... No!		
Hee hee. Why don't I return all the memories I've been holding on to?		
Nyaaagh!!!		
I blew it...		
What!?		
Huff...huff... It was you! ...... I thought... I thought I finally		
Hee hee. Now, Acro, why don't we play one last Game?		
You tricked me...		
The winner gets to be the Composer, and do whatever he likes with		
You're a monster...		
Acro? You'd better pick up that gun. I mean, this IS going to be a		
Don't screw with me, Souvik!		
I assure you, I'm not. Life's little crossroads are often as simple 		
......		
Acro... Hee hee, your face is priceless. Don't you remember what Mr.		
I'm just...		
Oh, before I forget! I've collected your entry fee. Now... Let the 		
Why... WHAT THE HELL!?		
Same streets...Same crowds too. Yeah, Shibuya hasn't changed a bit. But		
Let me in! Tell me what you're thinking!		
Only by allowing strangers in can we find new ways to be ourselves.		
I'm scared! Scared of getting a second chance...		
Listen up, Phones. Cuz I ain't askin' twice. Please, help me. You gotta		
Acro, that's the first time you used my name.		
But Acro, I thought you couldn't afford to lose. Give up on yourself,		
You ain't my partner anymore, man; you're... my friend.		
Once you see the real me... will we still be friends?		
I'm glad I met you guys. You made me... pick up on things, I probably

What!? That was... He's... (I knew he looked familiar. I've seen his		
Hey, bro! You really made it! WOW!		
(Don't sound so surprised. I'm gonna be the man to break you.)		
There you have it, folks! One of these four finalists will go home		
(Every slammer's dream pin. Gimme gimme!)		
Okey doke ? Now then... Cough up those pins, suckers.		
Huh!?		
Mwa ha ha! Nice work, boys!		
Is this part of the program!?		
What the- Not my phones! HANDS OFF THE PHONES!		
HEY!		
Get your-		
Watch the hands!		
Whew... Guess I kinda freaked there.		
My pins! Somebody stole all my pins!		
What!? They were stolen!?		
Mine, too!		
Somebody grab 'em!		
Damn... I was careless.		
They got me, too.		
Give them BACK!		
Thanks for the pins, people!		
We appreciate you bringing 'em all to one place.		
What are you talking about!?		
The fastest way to gather a vast number of pins is to have them		
Zip it, Yodai! Enough rhyming and unnecessary exposition.		
Sorry, ma'am!		
Give me back my pins, NOW! 		
No can do, shorty. We're gathering them for a reason. We need them 		
Who are you!?		
The Black Skullers! We're Tin Pin cullers, bent on purifying-		
Rhyming, Yodai. Exposition.		
Sorry, ma'am.		
We're done here, boys!		
So they're pin thieves!? ... Wait a sec. (I still have all mine. Guess		
Please remain calm. Due to mass pin thievery, we regret to		
(Guess they have no choice. Well, time to head home...)		
HEY, BRO! They took your pins too, right!? 		
Uhh... Y-yeah... Darn them. (If folks knew my pins were spared, I might		
There's only one thing left to do!		
What?		
Join me in taking back our SOULS!		
Our... what?		
Well, DUH. Our pins! Pins are every slammer's soul, bro.		
(Oh. The pins.)		
Now, rise up and fight! The time is nigh to join hands and take back		
Or to call the cops like a normal person...		
Meet us at the ramen shop in Dogenzaka!		
We're getting ramen?		
That's our secret base!		
You have a secret ramen base?		
Go tell Doc there what happened!		
There's a ramen doctor at your secret ramen base?		
Yuh-huh! Dr. Pin! He's AWESOME. Thanks, bro!		
Wait, why me!? 		
FEAR NOT! I'll be right behind you!		
The kid is completely mental... (A secret ramen base? Dr. Pin? I should		
(This must be the place.)		
Irrasshai! What'll it be? We have a limited time special right now--		
(Stardust? What does that taste like...) I, um... I'm looking for Dr.		
... What? Where did you hear that name?		
Huh!?		
MISS ME?		
Irrashai! Come on in.		
(Coulda sworn this guy changed channels on me for a second...)		
Oh! Back again, kid? 		
Hello, mister! Oh, hey, bro. Been waiting long?		
Er, no... I just got here a few-		
So BRO! Guess who I found. Kindred Spirits in our fight against (dun		
Kindred... what?		
Fall in, Spirits!		
Oh, so you're one of us? My, my. Those Black Skullers are in for it		
Wow... What a totally cool secret base! But I was expecting more		
Yo, is it true they sell curry here? A secret base ain't nothin' 		
This is a ramen shop! Not a curry shop. And not a secret base!		
OK, everybody! Eyes on me! Divided we were no better than Pinpricks.		
Red... Spirit?		
I'm Daisukeno- aw, screw it. Jus' call me Beat. Hey, Red, where's the		
(What, are we all calling him "Red" now?		
Stop your tummy-rumbling, Yellow. We're still doing intro-ductions!		
Yellow!?		
Sorry, Red. I just love me some food!		
(Yellow, Red... Are we reading off the crayon box?)		
My name's Shiki Misaki. I've never been a Spirit before, and I was a		
(But here you are. A Crayon Warrior.)		
I can't stay out too late. I have a curfew. But this should be fun!		
Yeah! Don't worry, we'll finish up in no time, Pink!		
No no no, I call Pink. The name is Yoshiya Kiryu. I should be Pink,		
(Now they're fighting over colors! Who cares... This kid's the craziest		
Well, I don't care which color you make me. I can make any hue look		
Then be Green.		
Green? WHy?		
Hee hee... The color of your skirt.		
Oh! Duh... See? I'm already making my color look good.		
You know, actually... I should be Gold. The color of wisdom.		
(First he steals her color, and now he complains? Where did Red... I		
Blue. You're up.		
B-Blue? You don't mean-		
Yup! Blue is you!		
You're joking.		
Hold on just a second. His shade of blue strikes me as more of a...		
Ooh, yeah! I like that!		
What do I look like, a bruise!?		
OK, Black 'n' Blue. Introduce yourself!		
Um... OK. I'm Acro-		
No, use your codename! 		
But-		
Yeah, good call!		
Quit ganging up on me!		
And now, last but not least- our powerful ally, Dr. Pin!		
Silence! You wanna eat asphalt? Stupid hectopascal.		
You're Dr. Pin?		
Well, aint this sweet... Looking' at you zetta twerps makes me wanna--		
(Ahhh! Bad man! Mustnt make eye contact... Ohh, please don't hurt me!)		
--join in on the fun!		
Huh? Join in the fun!		
Attention, you ramen-raiding radians!		
Gulp...		
I insist you make me a Spirit!		
Why would you want to be a CRAYON?		
So you're Dr. Pin? I've heard all about you. It's an honor, sir.		
Aww... Zetta shucks.		
(Is he... blushing? It makes him scarier...)		
So what bring you all here?		
Well, you see-		
Wow... That zettabytes.		
We want to get out pins back. What do you recommend?		
Some Old Horses Can Always Hear Their Owner Approach. Listen up, kid...		
But, Doc... We don't even know where the Skullers are... How can we		
Lure them out.		
Lure them? With what?		
......		
He's eyeing you, Black 'n' Blue. 		
Who, me? He's looking at me? (What'd I do?)		
What's up, Doc?		
You zetta morons! You haven't noticed? He's had them the whooole time...		
Gasp! Had what?		
Pins!		
What? Really!?		
Just as I'd suspected. You're a dastardly one, Brown 'n' Blue.		
Now I'm BROWN!?		
Yo, hook me up with some more curry!		
Black 'n' Blue... You lied to us?		
No! I just couldn't find the right moment to tell you!		
Oh, Black 'n' Blue. You're like a bruise on the tomato of my heart. 		
Go easy on him, Red. He's the key variable in your victory equation.		
Our victory equation?		
Black 'n' Blue is your bait!		
Wait, what!? 		
The Skullers are hunting for pins.		
Once they know you have some... They'll come to us.		
Very good. A+ for you. Hit the streets, radians. Play Tin Pin like 		
OK! Let's get to it!		
"Winning like crazy" may prove a challenge.		
No worries. Just use this. It's one of my originals.		
A Dr. Pin pin!? Awesome! We're gonna clean up wth this!		
That pin's a dud!		
Whaaat?		
It hits hard, but only once. Then... CRUNCH! Try it and see.		
Whoa! No joke...		
Scrapped on its second slam...		
You never did make much of a pin fiddler. Give it up already.		
... Hectopascal. I'm so better than you... I'm the best pin fiddler		
He sized up that pin with one glance... That ramen guy knows pins.		
......		
This is hella tasty, pops! Hit me with another bowl a' curry ramen, yo.		
Oh, sorry! We're fresh out. Go play with your friends. I'll whip up some		
Bwaaah! No more curry? Aight, guess we be slammin', then.		
(This is all so very weird...)		
HEY! Play me in Tin Pin!		
Um... Sorry. I can't play right now.		
She hates Tin Pin, yo.		
Friend of yours, Yellow? 		
Yeah... Sorta.		
No, I love Tin Pin.		
What? Since when?		
I'd play you, but somebody took my pins.		
Another victim of the great Molco slam-off heist?		
Hmm? No, I guy with a lollipop just ran by and nabbed them all. My 		
Oh, you poor thing..		
Don't be down! We'll fix everything! We're Kindred Spirits, fighting		
Wow. Can I help? I'm Rhyme, by the way.		
A new Spirit means a new color.		
(Here it comes...)		
Black 'n' Blue, you're demoted to just Blue.		
(Whatever, I'd rather be normal Blue anywa-- Ugh. I'm turning into one 		
And you can be Black now.		
Excuse me?		
Just ignore him.		
YEAH! Black joins the party!		
Freeze.		
!?		
Nice pins.		
You've sure got a bunch of 'em. Did you gather them all up just		
I want my pins back!		
Hee hee.		
(You tell him, Giggles...)		
It's time to take back our SOULS!		
He... he's good!		
Heh. You don't stand a chance. Now let's have those		
I can't let it end like this! A rematch! I demand a rematch!		
Heh, you're wasting your time...		
One more time!		
Heh heh. As many as you like.		
Nngh... So, you can slam.		
Welcome to today's turning point, folks.		
Kariya...		
!?		
Looks like I made it.		
Heh, just in time to get your ass whupped. We takin' the both a' you		
Actually I'm not here for the whup thing. I'm here for a pickup.		
What!?		
Sorry, Red. I'm just gonna borrow this.		
Wha-- Black!? Gimme back Red Kaiser!		
You can't slam without it, can you?		
N-NOOO!!! Black! HOW COULD YOU!? I thought we were friends! Kindred		
Friends? I'm a Black Skuller.		
Rhyme, you... No way.		
Yup, I was a spy. Just trying to wear you down, you know?		
Rhyme...		
Hee hee... I knew it.		
You did?		
She said it was Lollipop that stole her pins, but she asked Steroids		
(Is it true steroids can shrink your... Never mind.) Yeah... She wasn't		
That's right! Still waters run deep. I knew you were the sharp one,		
Rhyme, why?		
Uhh, more importantly... you could have told us this earlier.		
I really don't see how this is my fault. You're the one who refuses		
So it's MY fault!?		
WAAAH! My... my poor Red Kaiser...		
Wait, Rhyme! Why are you mixed up with those guys? 		
You still don't get it, Beat.		
Get what!?		
Red Kaiser...		
Pull it together, Red.		
What'll I do... How will I live?		
It's, uh... It's just a toy.		
It's too dangerous to wander around with out leader out of		
You DO know you can still play without that thing, right? 		
C'mon, yo, back to base. Curry's prob'ly ready now.		
(Always the team player.)		
Irassha-- oh, it's you kids. How goes?		
Hey, mister... Is Dr. Pin here? 		
What, you want Junior? Hey, why the long face? 		
Uh... this.		
Holy smashed Kaisers!		
I'm gonna get Dr. Pin to fix it! Then we're-		
He can't.		
What!?		
This is beyond Junior's ability. ... It's even beyond mine.		
All right, sir. It's about time you told us the truth.		
You trippin', Pinky? Brotha ain't a liar. Brotha's a ramen man. A ramen		
He knows too much about Tin Pin. He can size up any pin at a		
Yes! All right. You got me. I... I created Tin Pin.		
You invented Tin Pin!? And now you invent weird ramen!?		
Yes! And as the father of Tin Pin, I can't bear to see it used for evil.		
Mister... I'll do it! I lost Red Kaiser, but... but not my love for		
Thanks, son. I knew I could count on you kids.		
... I'll get by somehow. It's not like Red Kaiser really did		
Nothing!?		
It was like a lucky jock... Bracing!		
Eww!		
Lucky charms do help give you confidence. So take mine. You need them		
WHOA! These are...		
Color prototypes for the (new) Solid Slammers! They never hit shelves, 		
Kids, plural? You want me to wear that thing!? 		
Dibs on the rainbow.		
Of course. It was meant for you.		
OK, Pink is now Rainbow! 		
Ahh! Just look at this handiwork!		
Yeah, they're actually pretty hip. 		
Whoa! Just havin' it on makes me feel badass, yo!		
These prototypes must have cost a fortune... I can see why they were		
Try yours on, Blue!		
This isn't happening...		
Surely you wouldn't snub this man's generosity. Only a monster would		
(Freakin' Rainbow...) ...Fine. That still leaves the black one, though.		
Rhyme...		
Black was a spy. We'll leave it here.		
No! I'll carry it.		
Beat?		
Rhyme ain't... She ain't a bad person. They musta forced her, yo.		
...... Whatever keeps you happy, Yellow. Blue already has the emo		
Thanks, mister! No... Dr. Pin, Sr.! I swear I'll get those pins 		
I'm sure you will, young man. Their hideout is Miyashita Park.		
...... ...... ...... (How do you hide out in a park?)		
The jig is up, Black Skullers! We're taking back our PINS! 		
Rrgh... How did you find us?		
Spicy little thing, aren't ya? Bad timing, though. We were just 		
This smell... It's curry!		
Mr. Higgy is our private chef.		
M... maybe just one bite... NO! Stay strong, Beat! 		
Nice Tin Pin launchers... I see you've got some connections. Gee, I		
Snap out of it, Rhyme! It ain't never too late to come back, yo! 		
......		
Wha-- Rhyme!		
She's here because she wants to be, man. 		
Dammit! The evil's already got a hold a' her!		
Alright, villains! Get ready for a SLAMMIN'!		
Such fire! I see now why he picked you...		
That's RIGHT! We're the Kindred Spirits!		
Hmph... You talk big. Let's see if you can back it up. How 'bout we		
And once we win, you give back the pins you stole! 		
Deal.		
We'll play five matches. Anytime you're ready. HA HA HA! ... Ha.		
Leave round one to Rainbow. Who am I up against?		
Me. Tutorial Guy.		
... Excuse me? I'm up against an un-named character? What a waste.		
Like a bolt from the blue-		
What!?		
... It's, uh, just an expression.		
Wait... Those glasses! What are you doing here?		
Nngh... I knew it.		
......		
Again!		
Best of luck.		
I give. I give.		
... You were holding back.		
Not at all. Pracice makes perfect. Keep at it.		
I didn't win this match... He threw it.		
(What's the deal?)		
Tin Pin, yours is truly a mysterious world. I can't believe HE'S		
(What's he grumbling about? He won.)		
I'm up. Who's gonna bring it?		
Me, silly.		
... Why you doin' this, Rhyme? This ain't you!		
All you ever do is play Tin Pin. I got tired of nagging you to		
... That's wha this is about? Our stand-up routine?		
I figured I'd just get rid of Tin Pin.		
What do I gotta practice for, yo? People laugh at me anyway!		
That's not what this is about, Beat. You don't get it.		
Damn straight I don't! Le's settle this wid Tin Pin!		
Rrgh... I ain't givin' up!		
Beat... It's pointless to keep trying.		
Rrgh...		
I won! Booyaka!		
Great game, Beat. 		
Right? Victory's my middle name, yo. So c'mon, let's get back together.		
You want to pair up again? You're the one who called it off.		
(Wait, Beat gave HER the boot?)		
You got me all mad, yo... Stuff you said was seriously harsh, yo.		
Face it, Beat. People don't laugh at your jokes. They laugh at you.		
Who cares, so long as they laughin'? I know I'm an idiot... I can't 		
You can! You could make stand-up history! I know it. That's why I		
(Well, they've got their issues, but Rhyme doesn't seem like a bad		
I'm next.		
The pleasure is mine, young lady.		
Hold it!		
Wh-what!?		
Let me have her.		
But, boss... The boss is always supposed to go last. 		
Quit your whining! I've got a score to settle with this one.		
Yeah. Let's finish this!		
Y-yes, ma'am... Show here who's in charge...		
(These two know each other? What have they got against each other?)		
Nnnrrraaah!		
Hrraaaaaah!		
(Geez! They're wigging out! What the heck is their deal?)		
The real Prince fans are the-		
What?		
The Black Diablos!		
Wrong! The White Angels!		
As top minion for the Black Diablos... I'm gonna pitchfork your face!		
Well, as head seraph for the White Angels... I'M gonna bless your head		
Ha ha ha! You thought you could win?		
Nngh... I can't let her clip my wings!		
This isn't over! Prepare to be blessed!		
Hmph! Take your halo and shove it!		
Blessed!		
This... isn't... happening! The top minion never loses!		
Ex-top minion. As of today, there ARE no Black Diablos.		
Hmph... Fine.		
Don't worry, we'll let your girls into the Angels.		
... Thanks.		
I mean, we're all Prince fans, right? You're welcome to join, too.		
Pfft. The Prince is so yesterday. I'm into the indie scene now! I'll		
Wait, indies!? Like who?		
777		
Ahh! I'm totally into him, too! 		
WHAAAT!? You plan on getting in my way AGAIN!?		
I liked him first!		
Hrraaaaaah!		
Nnnrrraaah!		
(So much for that truce. With that much in common, you'd think they'd 		
So, you're taking me on?		
......		
You awake, kid?		
I was just thinking... Why are we here, fighting like this?		
A deep question, Blue. But worryin' won't get you anywhere. Life		
Yeah, it sure feels that way. There's a force at play that I can't		
Just go with the flow. Too much work tryin' to fight it.		
Sometimes I just feel so... emo. There, I said it.		
How 'bout some ramen? Take your mind off things.		
... Wait. Are you trying to buy me off with noodles?		
Busted, huh? Aight... If we have to do this the hard way...		
(Nngh... He's good!)		
What, that all ya got?		
One more round!		
Aight... Sock it to me.		
Served!		
Aww, look. I lost. Still feeling emo? 		
Now that you mention it... no...		
Congrats, kid.		
How come I feel better?		
Sure you don't already know the answer?		
Hmm... (Maybe I was just looking for something to care about.)		
NOW! It's my turn! Let's go!		
Say your prayers, little boy.		
Don't screw this up, Yodai... or else! 		
Oh, I'd never hand my precious pins over to them... or to you!		
Wh-what!?		
They're all mine!		
Are you crazy!? We were going to sell those online! At a huge premium,		
I was never with you Skullers to begin with. Your company was a		
Oh, zing!		
Who... who ARE you?		
The TRUE father of Tin Pin!		
Of course! There was a Y.H. on the original team!		
So he used to work with the ramen guy?		
The owner of the ramen shop was my supervisor. But my love for		
I heard he was obsessed, even from the onset... His love for the game		
(So... basically he's just a big geek?)		
If you really loved Tin Pin... You'd never do this!		
I love it more than you could ever know! The pins out today are		
You're wrong! It's not the maker that fills a pin with love! It's		
Feh. Childish. I will show you the shallowness of your LOVE!		
No! NOOO!		
Pathetic.		
Rrgh...		
I'm not through yet! Not until you see the truth!		
Truth? The truth is that you cannot win.		
Wuh-oh! (New) Red Kaiser can't take much more!		
Bwa ha ha! Of course not. Why do you think the (new) Solid		
I... I dunno...		
They say it was budget cuts and personal heartbreak... What they		
What!?		
My supervisor on the project-- he, too, was a victim of		
Dr. Pin, Sr.?		
His passion was commendable. The company never had much faith in		
(Who knew the ramen guy had so much backstory? )		
Wow... He must have faced a lot of hard choices.		
(Yeah... Not many fifth graders would get that.)		
Like... which color he should cancel first... or whether he should		
(Not many fifth graders... including you, apparently.)		
Tin Pin lost its light that day. Money-hungry fools swarmed in,		
Stop it, Higashizawa!		
Boss...		
I'm happy with my ramen shop. I don't regret leaving Tin Pin. And the		
And it will be! Once I finish purifying--		
That's zetta idiotic! Think you're some comic book hero?		
Junior, why are you here? 		
Dr. Pin!? What happened to you? You look TERRIBLE!		
Sorry to keep you, Red! It took a while, but I've done it! The		
The Omega Slammer!? SWEET!		
(What, did he get caught up in a lab explosion?)		
Attention, you Tin Pin-loving vectors! Pound that inverse idiot		
Heh... Absurd. You actually think that will help you?		
YES! Now get ready to hand over all our pins!		
Ridiculous. Did you really believe you could stop me?		
YES! I... I mean... EVENTUALLY!		
Heh... Absurd. You actually think that will help you?		
YES! Now get ready to hand over all our pins!		
I... I WON!		
Astounding... The Red Spirit, and the Solid Slammer Omega... You		
Not entirely. We sitll need you and Pop's help.		
But... I'm no longer worthy to slam...		
FOIL! First, Outer, Inner, Last! I just built off Pop's last		
You put it together from that half-baked sketch? Here I thought you were		
Hey, I love Tin Pin just as much as ram-crotch over here.		
... Except along the way, my love turned to hate. Thank you for		
Thanks, mister! Let's slam again soon, OK? I've never seen such hard		
Red...		
Ugh, honestly... You should've told us how you felt. 		
Sorry, boss... 		
Ha ha, I'm nobody's boss anymore. Now I'm just another 777 stalker.		
As if. 777 belongs to me and the White Maidens!		
Hrraaaaaah!		
Nnnrrraaah!		
Anyway, I guess this is happily ever after. Now, how 'bout we 		
Ramen? Naw, yo. It takes curry flavor to curry my favor!		
Ha ha ha! There, Beat, see? That was funny!		
Rhyme... I... I think I understand.		
Welcome to the world of intentional comedy. Hey, Mr. Higgy. Can you 		
Did you say CURRY!?		
He cooks like a pro. Please, Mr. Higgy?		
Rhyme... You really do love me... But yo, we need a kitchen.		
You can use my place.		
Boss... You don't mind?		
Don't be silly.		
It's zetta cool. Use our shop. It's also a fine spot for Tin Pin		
Yeah, our secret base! Gya ha ha!		
(Tin Pin Slammer's won over all these people... Who came up with such a		
C'mon, Blue! Let's head back to Molco! 		
Hmm? Oh, OK.		
Another town, another band of Kindred Spirits. That takes care 		
Wow, it's so empty here! 		
Yeah, it was packed before.		
Another party's ended... It's kinda sad.		
But isn't that always the case? Endings are sudden, often cruel. You		
(Today was incredibly weird... but I had a lot of fun.)		
Hey, Blue!		
Hmm?		
Let's play Tin Pin! We never got to throw down at Molco, but I knew		
Red and Blue, eternal rivals... It was unavoidable.		
You really are all crazy. ... But I was looking for a chance to take		
Ready, Red?		
I'm ready.		
Then let's SLAM!		
Rrgh!		
You were close! I'll meet you at Molco any time you wanna		
(It's weird... I lost, but I still feel good. Oh, Tin Pin. 		
......		
......		
I won... I beat the Shibuya champ!		
You know what that means, Blue... The title's yours!		
Eh, this wasn't an official match. I'll see you at next year's slam-		
(I feel so much better! Take that, emo urges! I didn't need anything		
There you are. I've been looking for you.		
And I, waiting for you. 		
Who's he?		
I'll give you a hint: "Like a bolt from the blue..."		
Wait, seriously? Then you were with the Black Skullers! 		
Meet the architect of Tin Pin's success. Shinji Hashimoto... The		
Him!? He's the Producer!?		
Impressive as always, Souvik. I knew I couldn't fool you. 		
Why would you go along with those thieves?		
I was confident. Confident in the possibilities.		
That Dr. Pin would complete the Omega Slammer?		
A team works smoothest when it focuses on the goal at hand-- on		
So this was all just part of your grand scheme?		
There are no concidences in this world, Souvik. Only cause and		
Including our meetng you here?		
Of course. Now, how about a game of Tin Pin? Let me see how far		
Me! Me! Ohh, ME!		
I'll select my own opponent.		
What? How come!?		
Cause and effect. Blue. I choose you.		
Me?		
Now, let us begin. Face the Wizard of Slam's might!		
Nngh! He's... he's not human! His technique is ridiculous!		
Come, now. Surely you can do better.		
One more... Let's play one more time!		
As you wish.		
YES!		
Well done, Kindred Spirits! See how inseparable Tin Pin has made		
Inserparable... and inpincible!		
Ha ha, indeed. My work here is done. I trust Shibuya will be in		
Wait, you're LEAVING? But we just got to meet you...		
Someone has to spread Tin Pin to the masses. We all have our		
He... He's gone.		
Wonder where he's going... I hope we see him again soon!		
Count on it! (Tin Pin, you are a trick of fate... A microcosm of my

Mr. Hanekoma, what's gotten into you? 		
Mr. Hanekoma... Why are you attack--		
What?		
Wha-- Wait! Please, wait! What on earth... Was that really even him? 		
Hey, got time to play me in Tin Pin?		
Tin Pin? Sorry, not right now. I have to get over to Molco.		
... Oh.		
For the slam-off. Aren't you going? I thought all the boys were...		
Oh, I'm going... I just figured I'd warm up first.		
Gotcha. Hmm... Oh, what the hey. One round. I can make time.		
Sweet! Get ready...		
Woo hoo! Go me!		
Ugh... How could I lose?		
Maybe I have a shot at becoming champion after all.		
Why do you want to be champion?		
Oh, I have my reasons...		
(... Like? Hmph, whatever.)		
Hey, no fair!		
What's not fair?		
Since when are you so good?		
... Since when are you so BAD?		
There go my dreams of becoming the champ...		
The price of sucking, I'm afraid.		
I know! Why don't YOU become the champion?		
Um... OK? I mean, that was the plan.		
Then, after he gives you the prize, shake my hand. Promise!		
(... After WHO gives me the prize?)		
(This is the Shibuya River. I can't think of any reason to go in there		
Well, here there, tiger! 		
Oh, hey, Mr. Sota!		
Decided to grow out your mane?		
Oh, this? Naw. I need to get it cut. 		
Rawr! Then tell ya what, sport. Drop by my place and we'll get your 		
Well, I'd like to, but... See, right now... 		
Wuh-oh. Lemme guess. The slam-off?		
Yeah. You know about it? I thought you didn't play.		
I took it up! Better late than never.		
Really!? Then how 'bout a match?		
Sure, champ. Just go easy on me!		
I... I won!?		
Are you serious? (I lost to a beginner?)		
Wow, that was a blast! Maybe I should enter the slam-off.		
Couldn't hurt! (Just be ready for payback.)		
Aight, dawg! Molco, here I come!		
(...Did Mr. Sota just call me "dawg"? Where'd he pick THAT 		
Well, dang! I've got a ways to go.		
I think you did great for just starting out.		
Thanks, tiger! I had a blast. Maybe I should enter the slam-off.		
Couldn't hurt!		
Good deal. So how 'bout that trim? You can be my haircut model!		
Um, OK?  ("Haircut model"? Is that a euphemism for "guinea pig"? My 		
Hey, wanna play me in Tin Pin?		
Tin Pin? I'm kinda workin' right now. Got some errands.		
Oh... OK, later.		
Hey hey, hold up! You don't have to give in so easily! This is Japan.		
Sigh... You won't forget to run your errands?		
No! Of course not.		
("No" meaning "yes"?)		
Yeeeah! Take that! C'mon, one more match for good measure.		
What about your errands?		
Eh, work can wait. They're not the boss of me.		
(... Um, aren't they?)		
Oh, hold up. Today's that slam-off at Molco...		
(Right... I'd better head over of I'll miss registration.)		
... Perfect! I'm gonna enter!		
(... And your errands?)		
Damn! I lost. C'mon, one more match! 		
Don't you have errands to run?		
Aw, crap! That's right. You better enter the slam-off at Molco!		
I will.		
Good! Be ready for vengeance!		
(... And your errands?)		
Uhh... Hello? ...... (Nobody's home. Guess I'll try back later.)		
Hey, wanna play me in Tin Pin?		
Tin Pin? Sure, for a little while. But then I have to go to Molco.		
You're entering the slam-off?		
Yup yup! But mostly to get my prints on the Prince.		
(Get your... what?)		
I've never actually played Tin Pin before. This'll be good practice!		
Whoa! How did THAT happen!?		
Stupid, Acro, stupid! (How could I lose to a beginner?)		
Hmm... Could be I'm champion material.		
(Ugh... I've created a monster.)		
And if I win, the Prince will TOUCH ME when he hands me the		
(... That explains the sudden interest in Tin Pin. Well, 		
Aww... I lost. Oh, well. It WAS my first time.		
(Actually, that was still pretty sad...)		
Good luck at the slam-off. Hope you win.		
That's the plan.		
Then the Prince himself will hand you the grand prize!		
(... And that's why you're entering?)		
Hey, wanna play me in Tin Pin?		
Tin Pin? Sorry. I'm looking for somebody right now.		
Who?		
We're holding an event at Molco, but our special guest, the Prince, 		
Oh, well. Maybe another time, then.		
Hey! Wait a sec! So you like Tin Pin? You should read our magazine,		
You work for PW? I buy every issue! The "Pinside Edition" feature is my		
Ha ha, yeah. That's our most popular column. You know... what the 		
Eh... heh heh... Oops! I won. Sorry...		
(Dang it! I had him... If only I'd--)		
Oh, now cheer up. You had a rough game, but I know talent		
At this rate, I'll never win the slam-off.		
Sure you will. Just keep reading Pinhead Weekly!		
Yeah... I think I will! (Hey, wait... Was this all a sales		
Darn! I seem to have lost! You gave me quite a workout.		
(Um... right.)		
So tell me... Where'd you learn to play like that?		
Well... from Pinhead Weekly, I guess.		
You're KIDDING! ... Tell your friends!		
(Did he just lose on purpose to push a few extra subscriptions? Geez...		
Hey, wanna play me in Tin Pin?		
Tin Pin? Heh heh... Take me on and it may be the last game you ever		
What's that supposed to mean?		
Enter the Molco slam-off and you'll see... you'll see... you'll

......		
(Whoa! Get a load of that thug! He looks ready to grab my wallet... or		
Hey, wanna play me in Tin Pin?		
Hells yeah! I love me some Tin Pin! Oh, but... you should just go to		
For the slam-off?		
You know about it? Then whatchu hangin' around here for, man? You can		
I know. I just wanted to warm up.		
Hmm... I was finna grab me some curry beforehand. Shame I have to call		
Nah, it's cool. I'll hit somebody else up.		
Bwaaah! No no wait! I'll play ya!		
(If you want to play, just come out and say it!)		
Aight. Get ready!		
Heh, I won. Eat it, yo!		
(Dammit.)		
Aight, man, curry's on you! Le's go.		
(Nice of you to mention that NOW.) What about the slam-off,		
Oh... right! Curry takes a rain check.		
(Enough about the curry! The kid's obsessed...)		
Damn! I lost... Yo, you good, man.		
I'm all right, I guess.		
Too bad... I was gonna treat ya to curry if I won.		
(Funny you mention that after LOSING.)		
Well, I gotta bounce. See ya at the slam-off, man.		
Yup. (I hope so. If I face him, I'm bound to win.)		
Hey, wanna play me in Tin Pin?		
Tin Pin? Hmm, I'm not very good.		
That's OK.		
There's a slam-off at Molco today. You'll probably find a beter		
I can go after I play you.		
Heh, all right. You're on!		
No way... I won!?		
(Dang it...)		
You think I could win the slam-off?		
Hey, enter and see. (... But I'm gonna have to crush you.)		
Ooh! Look at the time! I'd better go sign up!		
See? I told you.		
Naw, you did great. 		
Really? Thanks! So you're playing in the slam-off? Good luck. I hope		
I'll win.		
Ooh! Look at the time! You'd better get going.		
Hey, wanna play me in Tin Pin?		
Tin Pin? Why not sign up for the slam-off at Molco?		
I am. I just wanted to warm up first.		
Oh, good for you! Actually, I'm the event's sponsor.		
Oh, cool!		
You should hurry along, though. You don't want to miss		
Hey, that's right! (I'd better get over to Molco.)		
Excuse me--		
My autograph? Sure.		
Whoa, wha-- Why are you writing on my clothes!?		
Huh?		
This is permanent marker! It won't wash out!		
You wanted my autograph...		
No! No, I didn't. Why would I? You're a total stranger!		
Don't you know who I am?		
(Like I care.)		
My name is Eiji Oji, but some call me... the Prince? TV personality?		
(Weirdo? Egomaniac? Vandal?)		
I can't believe you've never heard of me. Don't you follow the		
Wh-who cares!? My parents say TV warps the mind.		
Oh, you poor thing. You're like a bird in a cage. However do you 		
That's easy. Tin Pin Slammer!		
Oh... Now you're talking! I've been playing up a storm. Care to take		
I thought you'd never ask.		
I win.		
He's good. Insanely good.		
I suppose luck might have been a factor. Don't let it get		
I'm not down!		
Hey, why don't we take a picture? I'll post it to my blog		
(Nooo thank you. You want everybody to know I lost?)		
Come on, don't be shy. I'll put a bar over your eyes. No 		
Sorry, but no!		
Look at him run. So bashful!		
Well, well. Not too shabby.		
Well, duh. I live for this game.		
Oh ho! Edgy! I like it.		
I'm not edgy...		
Hey! Why don't we take a pciture? I'll post it to my blog.		
(Nooo thank you.)		
Come on, don't be shy. I'll put a bar over your eyes. No one will		
Sorry, but no!		
Look at him run. So bashful!		
Hey, wanna play me in--		
Say, did you know? We all perceive the world around us differently,		
Huh!? (Is this kid high?)		
So if you're wondering why a certain young lady still looks like		
Young lady?		
The only thing stopping you from seeing what she really looks like...		
I need to look harder?		
That's right. Let go of your preconceptions.		
Um... you know... I was just gonna ask if you wanted to play Tin Pin,		
Hmm? Tin Pin? We already played.		
What? We did not!		
Weren't you listening? Like I said, you only see what you want to 		
(How come I always pick the crazies to talk to...)		
When you're drowning in a sea of work with not enough time, why pour		
Whew... (What was that all about? Kid plays too many video games.)		
Hey, wanna play me in Tin Pin?		
Tin Pin? But, like, I need to go to Molco.		
You're entering the slam-off?		
Like, yeah? The Prince is gonna be there to present the grand prize? His		
(The Prince's prints? Hmm... She means business. But is she good?) Hey,		
Like, sure? But just one.		
Super yay! I won!		
(Not good...)		
Now I, like, know I can win?		
(Over my dead body.)		
So, like, thanks? See you at Molco.		
(Hmph. Next time you're goin' down.)		
Ohh! I lost. You're, like, good at it?		
I'm OK, I guess.		
That was really good practice! Now I, like, really think I can win?		
(Hmm... She's a tough nut to crack.)		
So, like, thanks? See you at Molco.		
Heeey, it's Shiki! You gonna, like, have the stuff ready? Only seven 		
I'm on it! Once he sees what we're all wearing, the Prince is going to		
("Stuff"? What the heck are they planning?)		
Say, Green. What are you making? 		
T-Shirts with letters stitched onto them. We're gonna, like, wear 'em 		
Dare I ask what?		
Super Princely Birthday Love Magic? He's gonna, like, totally love it?		
......		
I hear he's really into Tin Pin these days.		
Yeah, I read! So I, like, took it up, too?		
Hey, why don't we play? 		
Like, sure?		
Wow, I, like, totally won? 		
Rrgh...		
I'll play you anytime you want? Just, like, let me know? 		
Wanna, like, play again?		
Like, yeah? But this time I wanna win?		
Ha ha, we'll see about that.		
Go, Black 'n' BLue! You're a genius!		
(... Please stop with the codenames.)		
Well, here's my pin. I'm so, like, jealous, Shiki? You've got your 		
Oh, this? This kind of just happened...		
What are you saying, Green!? We kindred Spirits are bound by FATE! 		
(Not only did he name us after crayons-- apparently he's been EATING		
Don't worry about the shirts, Nao-Nao. They'll be ready.		
Awesome!		
(Pork City...)		
Yo, wassup?		
Oh, I was just thinking about going in here.		
What? We busy, man! Go on your own time, yo.		
......		
WHOA! It's Eiji Oji! The PRINCE!		
In the flesh! Care for an autograph?		
Aaaaaah! It's the P-P-P- Puh Puh Puh Puh Puh Puh Puhhhhhh...		
I think Green's having a stroke.		
Hey, you three were finalists at the slam-off. Do you usually all 		
WOW! You know about us?		
Tin Pin's my latest little addiction. I know everything there is to		
Go for it, Green! You're a Prince fan, right?		
WHAT!? No way! nowaynowaynowaynowaynowaynoway!		
There she goes again. You'd think she'd be dying for quality time		
It's too embarrassing!		
As opposed to wearing weird T-shirts at some party?		
HEY! We're going to look awesome!		
(Whoops, now she's mad.)		
B-b-but yeah! I totally can't play the Prince! B-B-B-Blue! You do it!		
... Fine.		
And don't you dare beat him.		
(Whose side is she on?)		
Looks like someone still has a few things to learn.		
Rrgh...		
I'm always happy to teach.		
Another round of Tin Pin?		
Better believe it.		
All right, then. Whenever you're ready.		
Dethroned! How... unfortunate. But I'd expect no less from a		
I do not BELIEVE you, Black 'n' Blue! I TOLD you not to win!		
... Help!		
Y-Your Highness! I'm so sorry my brain-dead friend has no manners!		
Don't be silly. I had fun. Let's play again soon.		
Y-yes, sir! If he pleases you, sir, he's yours to play with anytime!!!		
(... I'm what?)		
Wow... He's gorgeous.		
(... I'm WHAT?)		
Howdy, Acro.		
Oh, hey, Pin Prof.		
Pin Prof!? Is he friends with Dr. Pin!?		
I just call him that because he knows all about pins. He's not like		
Wow, you know all about pins?		
A bit. See, first of all: you say pins? I say sharp design. All those		
(NO! Stupid kid got him started! Now he won't shut up for at least		
Yeah, I'd love to see your best pin, Prof! 		
Sure, guys. Hey, if you can beat me, Acro, I'll give you one. It's		
Seriously!?		
You better win, Blue!		
Ha ha! Tough luck, kiddo.		
Drrgh.		
Come on back after you up your game, Acro. I'll be here.		
You here to play, Acro? 		
Yes, sir!		
All righty! Let's get to it.		
Yeah! You won!		
Almost had you. Well, here you go, guys. 		
This is your top pin, Prof? I can see why! It's sparkling! 		
I talk to 'em as I polish 'em every day. Pins are a guy's best friend.		
Wow, Pin Prof! Such WISDOM!		
(That's... That's actually kind of creepy.)		
I'll start talking to mind, too! Thanks for the hot tip!		
Oh, and when you go to polish your pins... be careful what sort of 		
(NOOO! He's winding up! We're looking at five straight days!) Sorry,		
Hiya, Shiki. You're going to the Prince's Birthday Bash, right? 		
Do you need to ask? It's, like, the most important day of the year. 		
Great, that makes all of the White Angels!		
White Angels?		
One of the Prince's fan gangs. They're at war.		
(A fan gang war?)		
Those Black Diablo posers are showing up, too. We've gotta be ready! 		
(Angels and Diablos? That seems... kinda off.) ... Yeah, that's all		
Oh, sorry! I was off in Prince Land.		
(... Right.)		
Good luck, Blue!		
Woo! I won!		
Rrgh...		
We should do that again!		
Want to play some Tin Pin?		
Yeah... This time I'm serious!		
Heh heh, bring it!		
Yay!		
Aww... Here, this is yours.		
THANKS! We'll put your White Angel soul to good use!		
Heh heh. See you at the Bash.		
Yup yup!		
Have fun slamming and all, but don't forget to be ready for those		
Oh, hey, Beat.		
Yo, Ai! 		
Is this your girlfriend, Yellow?		
Naw, she lives in my 'hood. We've been friends since forever.		
Aww, that's sweet.		
Beat always shows me his material.		
(Material? What, does his family sell fabric?)		
Oh, that reminds me! Do that one from before again! 		
Bwaaah! ... Shh! That one's still a secret!		
HA HA HA! Your face is hilarious.		
Yellow, you look like you jumped out of a comic book!		
Shut it, Green! 		
His comedy routine is the bomb.		
(Ohh. ... He does stand-up?)		
A-anyway! C'mon, le's get some Tin Pin up in here. You game, Ai?		
Sure! I had most of my pins ganked at the slam-off, but I have enough 		
Yaaay! You lose.		
Hey!		
Ha ha, let's go again.		
Want to go again?		
You gotta ask?		
Ha ha, OK. Here we go!		
Yeah!		
Boo! Fine, take this.		
Thanks, Ai!		
Don't worry! We'll get the rest of you		
If you say so... Sounds like you're on a mission. Good luck.		
Leave it to us!		
You too, Beat. With Tin Pin... and with your act.		
Bwaaah! ... Shh! That's a SECRET!		
HA HA HA! That face never gets old.		
Sup, Beat?		
Na' much, man.		
Hey, Futoshi. How's work at A-East?		
You know the F-Bomb too, Green?		
F-Bomb? Ha ha, sort of. I'm at A-East, like, every week to see the		
Oh, so you're there to watch.		
As opposed to what, Yellow?		
Beat here opens with a stand-up act.		
Bwaaah! I said to tell NO ONE!		
Why hide it? You should be advertising!		
Step off my grill, Red! 'Sides... We done. 		
What, you two broke it off?		
She didn't gimme no choice, yo.		
You don't have to tell us you don't want, but...		
...... Let's play a little game. Blue here plays your F-Bomb. If he		
You down with that, Beat?		
Bwaaah! How is THAT fair?		
Sounds like I can't afford to lose this fight.		
Whatever, kid. But just so you know... I can control two pins at the 		
No way!		
Way.		
Wah waaah! My win.		
Rrgh...		
I'll take you on anytime, kid. I'm not busy.		
Mmm? Tin Pin again?		
C'mon, let's do this.		
Sigh... Yeah. OK.		
Done!		
OK, Yellow! Go on, get it out of your system!		
...... Me 'n Rhyme... My sister, yeah? We were doin' the comedy bit. 		
That's cute! I love stand-up. Tell us one of your jokes!		
... I got fired. She fired me.		
Ouch...		
Aww, don't let it get to you. Show a little spirit! A little Kindred		
I just might do that, yo! I have more fun slammin' anyway.		
This is...		
The Shibuya River. It stretches 2.6 km between the Miyamasu and		
What!? A sewer?		
An' you finna go in there?		
There could be something inside.		
Sorry, but I'll pass. These boots were so not made for sewer-walking.		
Yeah, this ain't my style either, yo.		
I guess that's understandable. All right, I'll go check it out.		
Whoa there, Black 'n' Blue. I'm going with. 		
You? You seem the LAST person who'd want to go in there.		
I could never live with myself if I let you go alone. Let's spend		
Whoa ho ho! You guys are... Like, you ain't...		
Blue and Pink!? Sure, they go.. but I didn't know they went LIKE THAT!		
Now look what you've done!		
Hee hee... Shut up and walk, dear.		
... I'm going, too. If something happens, I want to see... I mean stop		
Whatever, I'll go, too.		
(Sigh...)		
What... what IS this place?		
Uh... it's a river.		
Like a channel dividing this world from the next...		
The Styx of Shibuya?		
Hey, c'mon. Don't make this creepier than it has to be.		
It's a common misconception that Charon ferried the dead across the		
Thrilling.		
But, like... this ins't really the Styx, is it? 		
Does this look like Greece to you? Just ignore him.		
The hell is this place!?		
No joke! It's like Chez Sewer's Bar and Lounge down here!		
Seriously...		
......		
Hey, bro! Let's play some Tin Pin!		
Sure, all right.		
Wait...		
Close! But actually I'm second in line: The Vice Wizard of Slam.		
WHOA! So do you have secret tips for winning at Tin Pin?		
A couple, yeah.		
WHOA! Teach me? Woo! I'm totally gonna level up!		
That's if you win.		
Awright, you're ON!		
Just so you know, I'm wicked tough. I can control three pins at once. 		
Wha--		
Ready GO!		
Ooh, too bad! 		
He's good... Too good!		
I'm sure you'll get me next time. Come back whenever you want		
More Tin Pin?		
Yes, please! Gimme gimme!		
Heh heh, sure. Grab your pins! 		
Yeah! I win!		
Augh... I blew it. One more time!		
Wait, where's my secret tip? 		
Oh, my bad. Right. It's all about concentration. You've gotta focus every		
OK!		
Then, picture yourself winning in your mind.		
Right!		
Then you'll always win!		
Um... A little more specific?		
It's also important to have a victory pose decided on before you play.		
Oh, c'mon. That advice stinks!		
Hey, don't bite the hand that feeds you, kid.		
Right, SORRY! Umm... I'll work on focusing and imagining!		
(Poor kid can't see he's being messed with.)		
Whoa... This graffiti is--		
CAT's work.		
It looks like the wall tag in Udagawa... (Then wait, was that last		
You all right, Black 'n' Blue? C'mon.		
OK...		
This place is huge!		
I never knew Shibuya had a basement		
This is the Room of Reckoning. That throne seats the one who rules		
What?		
Say, Acro... What would you do if I asked you to play a game with me		
I'd think you were crazy!		
Hey! There's somebody in here!		
What!?		
Hello there, Acro.		
Wh-wh-what the heck!?		
I suppose I should say, nice to meet you... in this world.		
Pink has a t-twin!?		
OK, yo, this ain't funny! Who led us into the hall a' mirrors!?		
I come from a world parallel to this one. Existence branched and our		
A parallel world?		
I ran into a spot of trouble there. Nothing major. Heh, about one		
No wonder they keep this kid locked in the basement!		
So your world isn't peaceful?		
At the moment? Not exactly. But I assume Acro is holding down the		
Me?		
The other Acro. From my world. Anyway, I'm expecting my ride home... 		
Your ride?		
Say! Let's play a game to kill some time. I always wanted to duke it		
Duke it out?		
Yes, but my Acro is busy with the Game. Can't really bother him.		
Wait, hold up. Why should I fight you? 		
I told you. I'm just looking to kill some time. But let's see... If		
Well... Yeah, I guess. 		
Hee hee... Just tell me when you're ready. And be ready. I dont'		
Ready?		
Hee hee... Whenever you're ready, Acro.		
Then let's begin.		
Hah!		
Nice work, Acro. I knew I was right to pick you. ... Not that you're		
Hello again. Here to pass the time?		
Fabulous, Acro. You won again. Hee hee... You sure know how to show 		
Hi, Shooter.		
Hey there, Yammer!		
Yammer? Someone actually named their kid "Yammer"?		
Yeah, he's my BFF! He's the one who told me about Tin Pin! He knows		
Yeah, but all that knowledge doesn't help me actually win. Shooter's		
Nice back-handed compliment, dude!		
Well, anyway, Shooter's good under pressure. If there was to get an		
(Or at least one freaky Tin Pin love-child...)		
C'mon, Yammer! Let's play! We need to gather up pins!		
I understand. I'm a victim, too. So I'll help... by destroying you 		
Hah! I'm telling you, my pins pwn!		
MAN, I can't believe I lost to Yammer...		
I'll play you again anytime you want. I'll be here		
Ready to play a round?		
Yeah!		
Heh. All right, then... Taste my re-re-re-tooled Yammer		
Fast as ever, Shooter... This is the only pin I've got. ...... 		
Thanks, Yammer! I'll take real good care of it!		
Oh! And some of the mods on it are really expensive, so be careful 		
OK! Will do!		
Oh! And if you lose to somebody, give them a different pin! Don't 		
OK! Will do!		
Oh! And--		
(I almost feel bad taking the kid's pin. Almost.)		
Aw, no! Mrs. K!?		
Beat? My goodness. I trust my seeing you loitering about here means		
It's my life. Who needs her!? As... as long as I got me Tin Pin an'		
Ugh. Who does Yellow think he's fooling? He's practically dripping		
......		
Listen carefully, Beat. We're going to play Tin Pin now. If I win...		
What!? How's that work out?		
Come to me, Beat.		
Rrgh... Aight. You leave me no choice... but to pit you against Blue		
What!? Hey, don't drag me into this! (... Why do I bother resisting?)		
Hee hee... I don't care who plays me. Every little lamb is equal in		
Divide and Conquer!		
My tactics are never wrong.		
Rrgh...		
Frustrated? Then come back for another schooling.		
Hmm? You wish to know defeat again?		
Yeah! ... I mean, no! Look, just play!		
Very well. Let's begin the lesson.		
Oh... Whoops. I won.		
You da man, B 'n' B!		
Yes, yes. Here's a pin for you. Oh, and Beat? Do be sure to patch		
I won, Mrs. K. I'ma live how I like.		
Maybe I shoulda lost...		
Don't be silly, Black 'n' Blue. You merely played your part. What		
Yeah, but... (Stop calling me Black 'n' Blue. Seriously.)		
Hoo, boy...		
Mr. President! Awful shame about the slam-off.		
You call that a shame? Try a catastrophe.		
Any ideas about who's behind it?		
Not a clue. They used a fake company name.		
But the commentator- they said he was deputy editor at PW, right?		
Another lie. How about you, Souvik? Any ideas? Could you ask 		
(He has people? Evil, talking bats I'd believe... but people?)		
I'll see what I can see.		
Hey, mister, let's SLAM!		
Well... all right. Just be ready. This prez has got skillz!		
Ha ha, try again in a few decades. Age is a fine		
Rrgh... He's good.		
Wanna go another round? I could use the distraction.		
Hmm? Tin Pin?		
I feel a win coming on!		
Ha ha! We'll see about that, kiddo.		
Excellent technique... Here, take this.		
Woohoo!		
You kids have got moxie. It does my heart good to see young		
You mean it does your wallet good.		
Can't it be both? Anyhow, I should move along.		
(OK, so this kid's not just some lunatic. He's a sharp, well-connected		
Hey, tiger! Whoa, that mane is completely out of control.		
It does kinda get in my eyes. I could use a cut.		
Friend of yours, Blue? 		
Hey's my stylist.		
Been whackin' this boy's hair fo ages now, ever since he was a little		
Nice! What was Blue like as a kid?		
Acro? He'd come in with clippings and say, "Do me like"--		
OK! Enough with the talking!		
Hee hee... "Do me like this!" You were that guy.		
And get this! The clippings were from--		
MORE than enough with the talking!		
Hey, Blue! If you lose this round of Tin Pin, you've gotta tell us! 		
Ooh, Tin Pin? That sounds like a fair deal.		
Don't I get a veto?		
Well, I'll be! I won!		
Rrgh...		
That was fun. Let's play again!		
Up for some Tin Pin, tiger?		
If it'll keep your mouth shut!		
Then let's get slammin'!		
THANK YOU!		
Just wait till I get my scissors at you, champ.		
Aww, no fun! I wanted to hear Blue's big secret!		
Yeah, what's so embarrassing about bringing in clippings? I'll grab 		
See, but you're clipping from fashion mags, not comic books.		
Hey!!! How did you...		
No way. You seriously brought in comics? Hee hee.		
(Stupid, Acro, stupid!)		
So you're really a big geek, Blue?		
Look, are we done here!? Let's just move on, OK!?		
Ahh, Souvik. A shame we couldn't cross pins at the slam-off. I was		
Who's this guy?		
He's the mayor.		
Of Shibuya!? (How far up do this kid's connections go?)		
So, now that Tin Pin has a criminal element, will the city step in 		
Over my cold, dead body. Tin Pin is still full of so many		
Hee hee... You're quite taken with it. I thought you considered it		
I did, once. But prejudice is an ugly thing. I should have given it a		
That's great! Let's play now!		
Very well. If that is what you choose... my two-headed serpent slam		
Heh. You simply aren't ready.		
He's... he's not HUMAN!		
Return when you have what it takes.		
Tin Pin again, is it?		
We play until I win!		
Or until I die of old age. Whichever comes first.		
Yes! I won!		
Wonderful... I see now why he picked you... Unnngh... I concede		
Thanks, I will! YOINK!		
We're looking for the ones who took all the pins. Do you know		
Alas, I do not. Though that large man seemed somehow familiar...		
...... Thanks, we'll take it from here.		
(Large man? Oh. Right. How could I forget the "booth babe"?)		
Well, well. Look who it is. Big surprise at the slam-off, hmm?		
Oh! Souvik! You topped the reader response survey again last week!		
Friend of yours, Pink?		
Indeed. I owe a lot to this gentleman.		
Nonsense. We at PW owe you far more! Souvik here writes a column for		
A column? About what?		
Hee hee. About things beyond your wildest fantasies.		
Huh!? (What the hell does THAT mean?)		
Hey, mister! Play us at Tin Pin!		
Sorry, guys. I've got a prep meeting at the magazine. ... Oh, twist 		
Beautiful. If we win, you extend my deadline.		
Wait, what? Oh, man, I hope I win this!		
Woo! I win!		
Rrgh...		
Boy, I love Tin Pin. I can never play just one round.		
Up for a quick game of Tin Pin?		
I'm up for a quick win!		
Ha ha, we'll see about that.		
Sigh... Lost again. You're good! Souvik sure knows how to pick 'em.		
Thanks for that extension.		
No! You can't... I can't...		
So this deadline-- what's it for?		
His column, of course. He's the middle-school columnist for "Pinhead		
WHOA! That's my favorite part of PW!		
Yeah! I picked up an issue-- mainly 'cause the Prince was on the		
It's the only thing I read, yo.		
Wow, you guys. I always scrap it. (... In an acid-proof scrapbook		
What a shame. I'm sure you'd love it.		
(I'll die before I talk.)		
So... if he doesn't make his deadline, 		
He doesn't make the magazine.		
WHAT!? I can't let that happen!		
Seriously! Your publisher friend's practically in tears.		
Dontchu make me pound it outta ya, Pink.		
Just write the stupid column.		
Wow, guys... You really care about Pinhead Weekly. I... I'm gonna 		
Ugh, fine. I'll have it to you on time. You have my word as a		
Hey, mister! Let's play Tin Pin!		
Energetic little thing, ain't ya? I'd love to play, kid... but I'm		
Like what, Mr. H? I could help you look.		
Hmm? A friend of yours? It's odd to see you so cooperative, Bruise.		
("Bruise"? I see we're jumping right to the point.) Mr. Hanekoma's the		
How charming.		
So? What are you looking for?		
Some reports I've written.		
Reports?		
Just some passing thoughts. Tying up loose ends, that sorta thing. I		
But they're important?		
Definitely. Ugh, this is a fine mess.		
If we see them anywhere, we'll grab them.		
Thanks, Acro. Just swear you'll never, ever read them. Ever. Forever.		
Uhh... Sure. (OK... What the heck did he write in them?)		
Hey, it's Beat 'n' Rhyme!		
Sup, Sevens.		
Omigosh! You're 777! I'm such a huge fan!		
Really? Domo arigato, babe.		
I thought she was a Prince fan.		
Hmm? What's that, Black 'n' Blue? You say you're JEALOUS?		
Wha- NO! And I thought SHE was Black now!		
You two got any hot new jokes?		
We're kind of on a break right now. Thought we might give Tin Pin a		
That's kind of a shame. I loved seeing you make Beat pull that face.		
Yo, right? I'm a genius.		
Or just dim.		
R-Rhyme...		
(Wow, she really cut him down. Wonder what happened...)		
Umm... Hey! Why don't we play a round of Tin Pin?		
YEAH! We're gathering pins! Because we're the Kindred Spirits!		
That's... I don't get it. But all right. I'll play ya. Let's light it		
And us.		
Def M      rch		
Heh. Sorry, kid.		
Agh...		
I'll let ya try again, though. Any time ya feel up to it.		
You up for Tin Pin?		
Better believe I am!		
Oh, I believe it. Let's go.		
I won!		
You're pretty good, kid. Here ya go. And you two? Whatever your deal is, 		
......		
Whew... We got away. That was pretty close, huh? If things look grim, 		
Hey, um... Aren't we, you know... running a LOT lately? I mean, 		
......		
Let's stand our ground when we can, OK?		
...... Fine.		
Acro! Stop running all the time!		
What's wrong with running?		
You're holding us back! What happens if we get a mission where we have		
......		
...You hear me? Ugh! You are such a chicken. Buck buck buck buck buck		
...... ...... ......		
(This is awkward...)		
Oh, we're running? You didn't seem the type.		
......		
Well, I suppose it's inevitable... sometimes. Hee hee...		
(I suppose you're an ass. All the time.)		
Oh, Acro? We seem to be running away an awful lot.		
Are not.		
Wait-- don't tell me you're struggling with combat! In your second		
......		
I know how capable you are, so I won't say another word. Hee hee...		
(Rrgh! Must...not... strangle!)		
......		
What?		
......		
...WHAT? Just say it!		
...... ...... ...... Well, you're awfully...		
What?		
...... ...... Hmm.		
(You know what? Bite me!)		
Yo, whatchu runnin' for, man?		
Why waste energy?		
Hmph. Aight then. But next time we stay an' fight.		
Yo, yo, what the hell!? Why you keep runnin'?		
Strategy. That's what you call a tactical retreat.		
Oh yeah? Well... He who stays an' fights away lives today another		
...... Um. No... I don't think that's how it goes.		
Whatever! As long as we on the offense! We gotta conquer us... some...		
Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo! NO! Men don't run! Men fight! Where your		
I told you, I'm being strategic.		
You'll never survive like that, yo!		
...... I'm sorry-- that sounded like worry.		
Wha-- N...no! I don't care 'bout you! Hells no!		
...... (Good.)		
Talk about your sketchy stores...		
Hey, kids? Um... Look around if you want, but... I ain't sellin'.		
Huh?		
The stuff in the case? It's special to me. So, like, if you want it?		
...... Then take it out of the damn case.		
Acro. Let's just browse, OK?		
That fuse? Sorry, ain't sellin'. That baby's custom-made. So, like...		
The cough drops? Sorry, ain't sellin'. You can't buy those in just 		
The dandy hat? Sorry, ain't sellin'. I mean, look at you. Aren't you		
"Love in a Heartbeat"? Sorry, ain't sellin'. And for the record: it's		
!		
What? You're not together? You young people, heh.		
You heard the man.		
I ain't sellin'.		
Let's go.		
I ain't sellin'.		
Easy, Acro. Let's just browse a bit.		
Acro! Your phone!		
A meme?		
Sigh... Another day with no sales... I know my ramen looks plain, 		
Acro! Your Phone!		
A meme?		
(! ...Cough drops?) Cough drops! Yeah! 777's always		
I have to hurry! [leaves]		
And away he goes.		
Maybe he'll buy the part now. Or maybe he won't... We'd better follow		
Look! He just went inside.		
Let's move.		
...OK, cough drops: check. But...I get the feeling I'm forgetting		
Acro, try another meme.		
Like some kind of part for repairs?		
It's no good. I keep thinking... and I keep drawing a blank.		
I know I'm supposed to pick something up. What WAS it? I		
(Until I left this morning,)		
(I was setting up the stage, right? Mics were set. 		
(! ...Ramen?) Actually... I am kinda hungry. Yeah... I stopped for		
Acro! There he is! He's not buying the part! He's...he's... eating?		
There y'are! The Ramen Don special!		
Wait...		
Eat up before it gets cold!		
Wait just a sec... ! Oh, crap! I'm supposed to be picking up that 		
Wait! Sir, your noodles! Sigh... I can't win. Young people just won't 		
Acro! After him!		
It's no good. I keep thinking... and I keep drawing a blank.		
(Until I left this morning,)		
(! ...Blackout?) Yeah! I need to fix the lighting. The guy told me to		
It's no good. I keep thinking... and I keep drawing a blank.		
(Until I left this morning,)		
(! ...Cough drops?) I bought the cough drops. All set with those.		
It's no good. I keep thinking... and I keep drawing a blank.		
(Until I left this morning,)		
(! ...Ramen?) No, no, no. Definitely not. Why do I keep thinking 		
I-I-I will! But first--		
What now?		
[hands over the cough drops] I thought you could use these before the		
Cough drops?		
I've really been looking forward to your concert!		
...... [takes the cough drops] ...Go on, get outta here.		
Right!		
Hey!		
Y-yeah?		
Let's make rock history, man.		
Y-you know it! [leaves]		
Good thing he picked those up, huh? And now we have light!		
Finally we can see inside.		
Hey! Thanks for everything. Here. For you. It's Def March band swag. One		
Ooh! Thanks!		
I better see you at the show. Later!		
All right! Let's finish this mission.		
Right!		
How's work going, Makoto?		
Bad. The boss wants me to promote some new pins. But how? I don't		
Sounds rough.		
Yeah. I've been trying to study up. Like, people use pins to play Tin		
The Tin Pin slam-off, huh... If you had a ticket, you'd go?		
Uh-huh.		
Hmm...		
Huh? Isn't that... ......		
Hey...Mina? Where were you yesterday?		
Yesterday? Ahh...umm... Ten-Fou! Yeah... The Prince was there for a		
Oh... So you weren't over by, say... Shibu Department Store?		
Huh? No! No... I don't think so. Why?		
Nothing. Never mind.		
...... ...Huh? 'Sup, Players. Want me to clear the wall? Then buy me 		
! Hey! You brought it! Yeaaah! This is the song! The melody's like a		
YEAH!!! I can't wait to play in the slam-off! C'mon, Yammer! You 		
The grand prize is a Hero Pin!? Dude! Those are sooo rare!		
Slam-off? What's that?		
Check the poster.		
"Tin Pin Slammer Super Slam-off!!! Mighty warriorrs, slam forth!" Ohh.		
Tin Pin Slammer, huh... (Just some stupid game.)		
Hmm... It's some kind of divination. I think you have to move the coin		
Whoa!		
Nuh-uh!		
It moved!		
...Huh?		
It's not moving.		
...Nothing.		
Hellooo?		
So quick! So decisive! That's my Reaper! Marvelous! ? ...Huh?		
So quick! So decisive! Thadda boy, Creepy! Marvelous! 		
This guy is pissing me off.		
Just try moving it more slowly, OK? Apparently that's more convincing.		
Is it [Black/White/the Gate]!?		
...not [Black/White/the Gate].		
I'm serious! Ai, please...		
Uh-huh. I believe you.		
Arrgh. No you don't. Come on...		
It's OK. I know.		
What!?		
...How you feel.		
(Shoot! She's so onto me! Now what? Do I just tell her?

It moved!		
Wow!		
Cool...		
...Hmm. No response.		
Oh, Reaper?		
Move, darn it!		
WHOA! Did you see that coin fly? Cool! ! But... Wait. Ai, did you move		
N...no!		
Heh heh, I'm kidding. We probably just shook the paper. Let's try one		
Am I really moving it that fast?		
Try doing it more slooowly. We ladies require a delicate touch.		
[Black/White/The Gate]?		
Oh! Not [Black/White/the Gate]...		
Black! Cool... The coin really moved! So, like... We said, "if you're		
That's right. And they can

There it goes...		
(It's gonna be White.)		
(Just watch.)		
Nothing...		
Come on, Reaper.		
Answer the question!		
Waaah! Hey!!! Mina! Don't move the paper!		
I... I didn't!		
Yeah, right. You can't fool me!		
Hey...Ai... What's gotten into you?		
REAPER. CREEPER.		
I knew it		
...What? [Black/The Gate]?		
Oh! Not [Black/White/the Gate]...		
Black? WHAT!?		
Um, Ai--		
(Black means NO. But that can't be true. I saw her with him yesterday.		
Ai... This isn't like		
The Gate? What is THAT!?		
Um, Ai--		
(The Gate means "neither." That makes zero sense! Whatever, I know she's		
Ai... This isn't like		
HEY!!! Mina! Stop moving the paper!		
I... I didn't!		
Stop interfering! This is IMPORTANT!		
Ahh... Please, Ai... You're scaring me. Snap out of it...		
REAPER. CREEPER.		
Why is it Black!?		
Please... Ai!		
The Reaper is lying! I saw you!		
...What?]		
...The Gate? That's ridiculous! Quit messing around, Reaper!!!		
Please... Ai!		
I know the truth. I saw you!

...Hey, wow. I'm kind of impressed. You can pass.		
The...the book! In my book it said--		
Stop mumbling, loser!		
Eep! I...I was just... Nothing! Never mind!		
Ooh, we're off to a great start. (I should use imprinting and help him

You know. Hot? Stuff?

Eep! I...I was just... Nothing! Never mind!

Huh?		
Un...unreal?		
Scuse me?]		
What's your name, bro?		
Me? I'm Makoto.		
Burnt Sienna!		
Huh?		
I dub thee the Burnt Sienna Slammurai!		
Huh? Umm...		
I'm Red!		
...Sure.		
Wow. That kid steamrolled him. I better step in.		
(Who...who is this kid!? I can't get a word in! What should I say?		
! Totally gnarly!		
WHOAAA!!!		
Huh?		
Bro! Where's your Solid Slammer?		
T-totally gnarly!		
What? What happened to it?		
It's totally gnarly!		
Bro, no! You can't let your Solid Slammer get bent outta shape! It's		
Um...right.		
! Come get some hot stuff!		
WHOAAA!!!		
Huh?		
Bro, did you watch Slammurai this week?		
H-hot stuff.		
REALLY!? Did they show any new pins!		
Hot stuff!		
Whoa! BRO!!!		
Um, yeah?		
If you loan me a Slammurai DVD, I'll let you join my forces of slam.		
Um...sure.		
Ahem... Who dropped all this MONEY? ...... Darn. There goes Plan B.		
(Think, Mick! You're so close. Which phrase haven't you used yet?

...Hey, wow, I'm kind of impressed. You can pass.		
...... Like a bolt from the blue, it's time for the Reaper Review.		
Hmm, you don't say... Question 2! They sell a pin there called Happy		
Well, aren't you so smart? Question 3! OK, another item they stock...		
Hmm, you sure about that? OK... The results are in! Reaper Review,		
You pass! So pass on through. [wall goes down] But! Though you may		
Bzzzt! So sorry! I can't let you pass-- until you pass.		
...... Did you do your homework, kids? Then away we go!

That's right. Come back wearing head-to-toe Natural Puppy threads. Do		
Satisfied?		
Wow... You actually kinda work that. Pretty brave, kid. But-- I'm not		
! Huh? The wall's gone...		
I'm sure one of the other Players probably cleared it. You are aware		
Yes, I realized, thank you. (Kiss my ass, Josh.)		
Sigh... We could be letting them do the entire mission, but nooo...		
...... You done?		
What? I... I lost?		
Heh heh! Did you really think you could win? Look at your pins, bro!		
Everyone knows you should mod your pins, Acro.		
M-mod them?		
Although, if you get carried away...		
Due to prohibited alterations to the pins used in the last match,		
What!?		
That's my Acro. You're one lucky dog.		
...I won. Whew, I'm safe.		
Rrgh! Can't believe I'm out on a DQ... Still, you're history next		
And why is that?		
You're facing the top seed. It's over.		
The top seed, huh...		
Dumb luck will only get you so far.		
Please! It's our hour of need here!		
(What's his deal?)		
How many hours of need does this make? You fed me the same line last		
But it's the truth!		
A customer? That'd be a change.		
He's back again?		
Sounds like serious business. We should probably come back later.		
Where'd he disappear to after he beat me? I want a rematch...		
Sucks what happened yesterday. I thought you had it in the bag,		
Yeah... The bro in the headphones took off, too. What was the big		
Hee hee... Sounds like you have a fan, Acro.		
......		
Ugh... This sucks. Why should we have to do this?		
!		
Those two are...		
Reapers!?		
What's the GM thinkin' when he makes this stuff? I really		
Don't ask me, man... Nobody can ever really tell what he's 		
No joke. If he sees us hauling his baby off... our asses		
Getting stuck in the middle of those two bites.		
......		
Looks like they're carting off that trash heap. At the rate they're		
Well, let's leave them to it.		
The tracker's responding here, but... I don't think it's what we're		
......		
Another junk pile... The Grim Heaper strikes again?		
Know anyone else who'd put something like this together?		
? ...There's something written on it.		
...... Uhh... what?		
I think he's saying he's better than gravity?		
...... Uh...huh.		
The tracker's responding here, but... I don't think it's what we're		
......		
AAAGH!		
That's Kariya six, Uzuki zerooo.		
One more! I can still make a comeback!		
What the...		
Reapers!?		
Are they fighting?		
This Tin Pin thing's pretty deep. ...Maybe too deep for you?		
Shut up and play! And, slaaam...		
Tin Pin Slammer!?		
They must be bored.		
Wait a... You again? Who plays the Game twice? Anyway, I'd love to 		
Hands off? What's that supposed to mean?		
Orders, straight from the top. Game Master says nobody touches the		
But, wait. Why would he--		
I wish I knew! [beep] ! ...Hmm? Ugh, phone. One sec. Yashiro here.		
I-I like...		
What? Speak up! Is this a crank call? Ugh, who in the hell? OK, that 		
Why call all the Reapers off? What's he thinking? ...I don't get it.		
Who knows? With his ego, he probably wants to play this Game solo.		
Wouldn't surprise me.		
Anyway, the signal's weaker here. Let's try another spot.		
......		
Like a bolt from the blue... It's time for a Tin Pin lesson, from me 		
Right. Every good lesson starts with the basics. [tutorial screen]		
Yeah, who doesn't love whammies? I do. [tutorial screen]		
Here's what whammies can do... for YOU. [tutorial screen]		
So many pins! How do you decide which ones to slam with? [tutorial		
Now you're ready to slam with the best. Perhaps another day, you may		
...... (Who is this guy?)		
AHH! The bro in the headphones!		
(You're... Oh, right, from yesterday.)		
Thanks for all your help.		
Huh? Shooter, do you know these guys?		
YEAH! I explained Tin Pin to 'em!		
Ouch... And they understood?		
You played Acro in the first round, right?		
And lost! Right, Yammer?		
I-I was having an off day! Today's a different story! I retooled my		
I smell a REMATCH!		
Heh... You think you can take me? 'Cause I don't think you can take		
Aww, you have fans, Acro. Why not indulge them?		
......		
Aww, man... I just modded my pins, too...		
Here to play a round with the boys?		
All right! Here I come!		
Ugh...		
Heh heh. You can't beat a Yammer special, man. My pins pwn.		
No freaking joke! What was with those?		
Yeah, but how much did you tweak those, Yammer?		
Wh-what? Don't give me that look! My mods are all legal!		
Rrgh! But my pins... That design should've been perfect! I tweaked		
(So basically, he was cheating...)		
You can't keep counting on mods, Yammer! They only get you so far!		
But I... No, you're right, Shooter. Here. You can have this pin. I 		
Um...OK? Thanks.		
Ooh, so how was yesterday? You went to the slam-off, right?		
Sort of... I mean, we went, but... Makoto says he's outgrown Tin Pin		
What? That sucks!		
He's like a totally different person lately. I..I wonder if it's		
It's not your fault, Ai! Don't beat yourself up.		
Thanks...		
Hey! How about some ramen? A new place opened up on Dogenzaka! The		
OK...sure. Thanks, Mina.		
A new ramen place, huh?		
Mmm, ramen. I'm a shio guy, myself. Plain and simple. How about you,		
Hmm... I dunno, shoyu?		
Hmm... Not very imaginative.		
(Well, excuse me!)		
Eh, I'd say miso.		
Interesting... ......		
......		
......		
(...What!?)		
Yeah, probably shio.		
My, my. We're twins. It must be fate.		
...Ugh.		
I like tonkotsu.		
Hmm... Very hip.		
(...I guess?)		
...... Guess who! Like a bolt from the blue, it's time for the Reaper		
WildKat. Which of the following will you		
Really? Question 2! I left my heard in Shibuya's phone booth of love!		
Is that your final answer? Question 3! Let's change up the flavor a		
He wrong the Musical Offering and		
What!? Seriously? OK... The results are in! Reaper Review, Lesson 3!		
Bzzzt! So sorry! I can't let you pass-- until you pass.		
...... Did you do your homework, kids? Then away we go!		
You pass! So pass on through. [wall goes down] But! Though you may		
Wait, Acro. The signal's getting weaker.		
So we're going the wrong way?		
Let's try another spot.		
Well?		
Hmm... The signal's pretty weak. Looks like we're headed		
...... ...Huh? 'Sup, Players. Want me to clear the wall? First, bring		
...Hey, wow. I'm kind of impressed. You can pass. ! Oh, and here. I		
Man, I'm starved... Ooh, what was that I saw on the Prince's blog?		
Ah, yes... The spicy tuna roll. It's a kind of sushi they serve 		
So what's in it?		
Tuna paired with a spicy sauce, then rolled up.		
Crazy.		
Think sushi, with a kick.		
Is it any good?		
I'm a fan.		
Hey, Yammer! Did you catch yesterday's show?		
Of course!		
Man, "Slammurai" is the BEST!		
It's really heating up towards the end!		
I knew Dead was hiding something from his past.		
Totally! Why would Black show up there... unless he and Yellow are		
I can't WAIT for next week! Plus the movie comes out in a month. I'm		
...What?		
It's a kid's show, Tin Pin Slammurai. It's very popular.		
Uh...huh.		
The leader, Dead, is locked in a duel with his rival, Black-- at 		
(...My partner watches kiddie TV.)		
! Hey, c'mon, wait your turn...		
I just have a few quick questions. Do you mind?		
(Wow, he cuts right to the chase...)		
Huh? About what? I'm here with a friend, so keep it short, OK?		
Why do you like the ramen here so much?		
Why? Uh, 'cause it's the most popular spot in Shibuya?		
(She likes it because it's popular?)		
And it's fun, don't you think? Where else do they dance while making 		
(And that has what to do with the ramen?)		
Plus, they gave me this cool limited-edition pin. How could anyone NOT		
But it's pretty new, right? How did it get this big this fast?		
The Prince wrote about it on his blog. I mean, he F'd it! How can I		
I see...		
So how's it taste? Good?		
Totally! The Prince said it was great. For 5,000 yen, it must be. Just		
(It's got a friggin' steak on it...)		
So where else do you go for ramen?		
Huh? For ramen? Umm... I dunno, noodles aren't really my thing. I 		
(Then what the hell are you doing here?)		
Ooh! That said... It'd be awesome to see, like, a dessert ramen!		
Dessert...ramen?		
Yeah! Like, all fruity and sweet!		
A tantalizing possibility.		
......		
Well, thanks. That was informative.		
OK. I'm gonna go eat, then.		
All right, then. Let's head out.		
I need to outsell that sorry excuse for a ramen shop... I need...		
Ugh, it's no use... Nothing's coming to me. So close, but...		
(Hmm, what would the kids like?)		
(What's hip? I need... something.		
! Yes! That's it! ...... Wait, no... That won't work.		
! Yes! That's it! [leaves]		
Oh! Perfect timing, boys! I'm trying out a new idea. Have a taste! I 		
(Unreal...)		
......		
......		
Mmm ? Very tasty!		
Yeah... This is pretty good!		
Kudos, mister! Still... It's missing something.		
Hrm... Yeah... I thought so, too. These silly experiments won't solve		
Hey, now...		
That's messed up. The ramen here is awesome, and nobody notices. But		
Welcome to capitalism, Acro.		
But why are they all up on that place? They don't even like the food.		
It's a conversation piece. People are always scrounging for something		
Ugh, they're sheep!		
Maybe all of Shibuya is.		
Gah ha ha... Well, thanks anyway, boys. But I'm not giving up yet. I'll		
! Yes! That's it!		
Oh! Perfect timing, boys! I'm trying out a new idea. Have a taste! I 		
(Unreal...)		
......		
......		
Mmm ? Dee-lish!		
Yeah, this hits the spot.		
Kudos, mister! Still... it's missing something.		
Hrm... Yeah... I thought so, too. But I'm not giving up yet. I'll keep		
...... ...Huh? 'Sup, Players. Want me to clear the wall? Hmm... Let's		
...... Daaamn, man! Didn't think you'd actually do it. Wall clear. So		
! Look who.		
We've been looking forever, and still nothing!		
Chill out, Uzuki. Slow and steady, girl.		
Are you kidding!? This is a direct order from Ms. Konishi! Don't you		
You actually look busy today.		
Very busy, thank you. We certainly don't have any time to waste on 		
Aight. Whatever...		
(Hmm, wonder what they were looking for.)		
The signal's getting weak. Let's try someplace else.		
......		
Another junk pile... The Grim Heaper strikes again?		
Know anyone else who'd put something like this together?		
? ...There's something written on it.		
...... Uhh... what? First of all, sounds don't really shake anything...		
I think he's saying he's better than air.		
...... Uh...huh.		
The tracker's responding here, but... I don't think it's what we're		
......		
HEY, BRO! You slammin'?		
Here to play a round with Shooter?		
Aww, but bro...		
AWRIGHT! Let's do this!		
Heh! You've got a ways to go.		
Rrgh...		
I'm up for a rematch! Any time you want!		
WOW, bro! You're getting good!		
I can't believe you beat Shooter!		
I let him win. I thought it'd be mean to crush him!		
(You little...)		
Still, bro, that was NICE! Take this.		
Care to see those shots again?		
It's empty.		
So the mic wasn't there yet.		
That's their microphone.		
? Huh? What's that black thing on the phone?		
Looks like a cell.		
Why bother with a pay phone if you've got a cell?		
That's BJ, right?		
It would seem so.		
What was he doing here?		
He may tell us if we show him this picture.		
We still have questioning to do. The one in black, BJ, is 		
We still have questioning to do. The one in black, BJ, is 		
Where were you yesterday at 2:00?		
! Oh, uh... I was... You know, uhh ...Dogenzaka! Yeah! In line for the 		
(Not the subtlest guy, huh?)		
Mm-hmm...		
Wh-what? Just gimme some space, would ya? I want to spend some time 		
Hee hee. Somehow, I doubt his story.		
Yeah, he's hiding something. Still--		
It'll take hard evidence to get him to fess up. ...So let's go find		
Hmmm, BJ's still not talking. Looks like it'll take a bit		
He's definitely hiding something.		
All right. Let's go check out the scene.		
What scene?		
The scene of the crime-- the one spot BJ swears he hasn't		
Hee hee... BJ can clam up all he likes. This photo is bound		
...... (Is it weird that I feel like the bad guy here?)		
We've taken care of BJ.		
Poor guy.		
That leaves Tenho.		
I didn't see him back at Molco.		
He can't have gone too far. Let's check the adjoining		
We've been to the scene and talked to BJ. That leaves...		
Well? Any luck?		
Not yet...		
Ugh... Guess it's time to call the cops.		
(Some Reaper you are...)		
Feeling pinned? Break down those boundaries. RED SKULL.		
! Hey, it's that commercial...		
Ooh! Ooh! Look, it's playing!		
That CAT pin is phat!		
You can't find that pin anywhere!		
It's really taken off... Even folks who seem like they wouldn't be into		
Like the guy handing them out at the ramen place. Looks like		
Shiki and I were pretty thorough.		
...... Looks an awful lot like the Player Pin, hmm?		
...... So who makes the Player Pins, anyway? The Reapers?		
Nope. That's Composer territory. He's responsible for creating and		
The Composer... The guy in charge of Shibuya?		
Correct. We're in the Composer's Game. The Reapers are just his		
Some designer. His Game royally sucks.		
Hee hee... Doesn't it?		
...... Can he and his Reapers go to the RG?		
RG, UG-- it's all the same Shibuya. Just, people in the RG can't see 		
So they have wings here, but not in the RG?		
Apparently a Reaper's wings house his power.		
So they're basically just normal people in the RG... ...... (So the		
Hmm? Something wrong, Acro?		
No. I'm fine.		
...... There's nothing there		
Huh?		
Acro... Wrong photo.		
You jerkin' us around?		
Proof my ass...		
Really, Acro. Stop fooling around.		
Hrm...		
That's our mic! It was in the phone booth by Molco? But I looked		
You jerkin' us around? That photo doesn't show anybody!		
Ahem... Acro? Wrong photo.		
HEY, BRO! You slammin'?		
Here to play a round with Shooter?		
Aww, but bro...		
HEY, BRO! You slammin'?		
Here to play a round with the boys?		
AWRIGHT! Let's do this! [Play Tin Pin]		
Heh! You've got a ways to go.		
Rrgh...		
But I'll replay you any time!		
I... I lost? ...... You're getting good at this.		
Heh heh... I hand-design and build all my pin mods. It's Yammer Time!		
Heh heh. The Yammer special pwns!		
Rrgh...		
Nooo! That design should've been perfect! I totally retooled my pins,		
(He cheated AGAIN?)		
!		
A wall, huh? Guess we're not going this way.		
Dammit. I can't break this one. Le's try a different way, yo!		
No sign of the pops. Yo, you think he came this way?		
Tee hee!		
Hey, wasn't that... What's she doing?		
Hey! Phones! Focus, man. The guy ain't here. We gotta check someplace		
The Reaper Creeper guy ain't down this way, man.		
Let's head back and check someplace else.		
Sigh... What am I gonna do?		
Hey... I know him.		
Nothing I do ever works out. I give up...		
Huh? Hey, Mick.		
Oh. Eiji... I-I mean, Mr. Oji.		
What's wrong? You look down.		
...... I'm a chronic failure. I left my job 'cause I thought I had		
What have you been doing with the ramen place?		
I closed it down for a while.		
What? Why!? The place was packed.		
At first. Then sales started to tumble, and I had no idea how to keep		
...... Mick, we had this talk before. The trends can make and break 		
Yeah, I remember. "Be more trendy." Is that it?		
No, it's not that simple. You can't just throw on a popular outfit 		
...... OK. I think I get it...		
Well, I gotta get to my next appointment. See you, Mick.		
Wear what feels right... DO what feels right... Aww... But what feels		
...... Like a bolt from the blue... No, this time I mean it-- I'm 		
Moving on... Question 2! Been mingling much? The pins you're wearing		
This is it! Question 3! Shibuya's got a fever, and the only		
It's over! OK... The results are in! Reaper Review, our final lesson!		
Bzzt! So sorry! I can't let you pass-- until you pass.		
...... Did you do your homework, kids? Then away we go!		
You pass! So pass on through. I'd say, "See you in the next life,"		
All right. Let's see where this takes us.		
Reaper... Creeper...		
Get ready to answer his question. An' remember: White is YES, black is		
What should Makoto do with his future?		
Huh!? That's not a yes-or-no question!		
Please, Reaper! Show me the way!		
Yo, just wing it, Phones!		
......		
What should Makoto do with his future.		
Yo, I dunno if White or Black matters, so just pick one and		
...Huh? It's not moving. Hellooo? ...Nothing.		
It moved! Gaaaaah! So quick! So decisive! That's my		
So quick! So decisive! Thadda boy, Creepy! Marvelous!		
This guy is pissing me off.		
Yo, you suck at this, Phones... Move it slooowly.		
It moved! Whoa! Nuh-uh!		
Is it Black?		
...Not Black.		
The Gate!?		
...Not the Gate.		
Is it White!?		
...Not White.		
Black! An answer, clear as day! Nothing beats Reaper Creeper 		
Red! An answer, clear as day! Nothing beats Reaper		
White! An answer, clear as day! Nothing beats Reaper		
...... It...it does!?		
All right, Makoto. I think I have your answer.		
Um, Boss, who were you talking to?		
I know you think your luck's dried up.		
Yeah... Nothing's going my way.		
Well, that's because... you need more BLACK in your life!		
Well, that's because... you need more RED in your 		
Well, that's because... you need more WHITE in your		
What?		
You heard me. Black! More darkness! More mystery!		
You heard me. Red! More... moulin rouge!		
You heard me. White! More pure-as-the-drive-		
Uh...uhmm...		
And I have just the product for you.		
But... Boss, I--		
I had to pull a few strings to get these, so--		
Boss, I... I have to run. Take care...		
W-wait, Makoto!		
You forgot your BLACK!		
You forgot your RED!		
You forgot your BLACK!		
......		
You see that? Mission cleared, yo!		
......		
Game over, Pinky! Come on out!		
......		
What, ain't she here? Wait a minute... Yo, did she trick us? Or maybe 		
......
